Tua Bisnon's domu.

&How-studente whom l dowered
witha noble shrine,

Token os the love l showered
While but lise was mine.

Ne'er can death make me forget

Thone with whom on earth l met.

Lest, perchance‚ ye moum my loes,
Ever think ol' this :

Though the earth retains my drose,
Yet my soul’s in bliss.

Tne Commodos Rem.

Dear were all thy giite to un,
Dearer still thy face,

ll' thou couldst be summoned thue,
Death we should embrace.

Fate is hard, nor changed can be;

We oen only pray sor thee.

ls to those who lived to praise
All their nires' renown
Glory comeo, to charm thy days,
Glory is thy crown.
And 'tis thine until what hour
Crumble Bridge and Church and Tower.-J.M.B.
