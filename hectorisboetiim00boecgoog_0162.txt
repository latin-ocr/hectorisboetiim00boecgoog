July,1305. John, Earl of Athol, shows the king that when he holds ples· of
justice, end ‘⁸ bygames entrent ’' . . . the Rishop of Aberdecn's clerks relieve and de·
mand the ‘⁴ bygemete '’ out of the lists court, and say its cognisance belongs'to them
in the court of Christianity, and so they will have delivery; and when clerks are entered
under indictment before the justiciar, so are they claimed hythe clergy, when we offer
thern the Bools to lmow if they are clerks, the clergy say this belongs to them, and will
