In ejus locum, canonicorum suffragiis, summi pontificis auctoritate
adbibita, suffectus GAVINUS DUNBARUS, ex veteri Dunbarorum
familia, generosis parentibus procreatus, in philosophia pontificioque
jure apprime eruditus. Erat is fido semper et constanti animo, studio·
sorum amator, scelerum censor, cultorque justitiae, et ob hoc Jacobi5
Quarti regis, adhuc privatus, secretioribus consiliis admotus, creditum·
que ei regium chartophylacium (nostrates registrum vocant) quod penes
eum jubente rege deinceps permansit. Hic statim ubi pontificatum
iniverat, Aberdoniam concessit. Prodiere adventantigobyiam Aherdon-
enses ciues, nobiles quoque qui in vicinia habitabant, honorationis causa. 10
Aberdoniam ingredienti omnia (et merito) honoris genera sunt adhibita.
Fiehant ingentes campanarum tinnitus, tibiarum, tubarumque clangores;
processere obviam religiosi viri, inde canonici et sacerdotes, omnes
sacras vestes admodum pretiosas induti; subsecutus gymnasii Aberdon· ’
ensis rector, cum viris scholasticis celebri admodum pompa: incredibili 15
laetitia, immenso cum gaudio, expectatum pastorem suscepere omnes.
Quodcunque templum ingrediebatur, fiebat et cantantium ‘et organorum ’
dulcis harmonia; fulgebant parietes aulaeis3 tapetibus sternebantur

philosophy and in the laws bearing on the duties of a bishop. ‘He was ever
distinguished for his faithful and consistent character; he was the patron
of the studione, the censor of crimes, the upholder of justice. For these .
qualities he was, while yet a private person, admitted to the private councifs
of KingJames the Fourth, and· entrusted with the royal archives, ie, with
what we call the register. This office, by the king’s orders, he continued to
hold aher he was made bishop. As soon as he entered on office, he cameto
Aherdeen. Τὴο citizens went out to meet him, by way of honour, along with
the nobfemen who lived in the neighbourhood. On entering Aberdeen,
every mark of honour was deservedly paid him. Bells were rung, fifes and
trumpets played. He was met by s procession of monks, muons and priests
arrayed iu costly sacred vestments. Then followed the rector of the college
with a great processioa of learned men. All displayed immense J‘oy, and
wdoomed the long-looked-for shepherd of their souls with incredible wurmth.
Whenever he entered a church he was grested with the sweet harm0ny of voice
