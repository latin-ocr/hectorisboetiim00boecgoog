vrbo, according to tradition, came to scotland with St. Rule in the eighth century.
The place was much resorted to by pilgrimo. The fact that Jamea 111. founded here
a collegiate charge in 1487 makes it likely that it is the scene of the incident. His
favourite place of pilgrimage was St. Duthac’a in Tain.

P. 77, l 12. Albany, the king’s brother, who had been imprisoned by James 111.
at Edinburgh, had escaped and found refuge at the court of Louis XL, who, according
to Comines (Scandalous chronicis), received him with all the marlia of honour and
civility imaginable; this was in 1479. Louis was anxious to secure an alliance with
fames, and so sent an embassy to him, asking him to pardon Albany and renew the
old alliance. Meanwhile Iouis had been playing with Edward 1v., holding out the
prospect of a marriage between the Dauphin and the Princesa Elizabeth. Edward
1v. had also been negotiating alliances with scotland, and now fearing that the French
and Scottiah iringa would renew their alliance, he entered into communication with
Albany‚ who was still in France, offering to put him on the Scottish throne. Albany
accepted the terma proposed by Edward, and prepared to make war on his brother.
See Rymer, Vol. XII. p. 14⁰· The disgraceful conditione accepted by Albany will
be found in Tytler, Vol. 1v. p. 229. The papera are aigned Alexander R. (ia, Rea).

Tytler mentions a previous embassy in ι484, in whichBishop Elphinstone took part.
Boece seems to say that he was made Bishop of Aberdcen on his return from this
embassy to England, but apparently he was Bishop of Aberdeen before he went on
tbcse embassies. See Tytler, Vol. 1v. pp. 246, 255, 261. One would think from
Boece's account, p. 74, that Elphinstone never accepted the See of Roas, whereas the
Reg. Ep. Aa, pref, p. xliv, shows that he did hold office in that see. Edward IV.
