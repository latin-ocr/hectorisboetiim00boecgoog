annos sederat. Ejus corpus, exenteratum, conditum aromatibus, inde

Et pinnae, quae motu ventorum indicant flatum, et ob hoc templorum
pinnaculis adhibitae, quae Aberdoniae fuere, aut ceciderunt aut effractae
sunt omnes. Quo etiam tempore Wilhelmi funus est elatum, pastoralis
baculus, ex argento conflatus, quem Alexander Laurentius (ut in funebri

village ten miles from Aberdeen‚ an infant was born with two heads and two

place, his pastoral staff, made of silver, which Alexander strence was carry-

happened, but one part of the staff fell into the grave where the body was to
he laid. Thena voice was heard, but whence it came was doubtful: “Thy
mitre, deo, 0 William, should be buried with thee ”.
