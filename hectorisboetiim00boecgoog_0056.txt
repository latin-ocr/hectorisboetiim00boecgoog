uvas 01² THE mauors OF ABERDBBN. 27

movit ad meliora, atque lachrymas excussit praesulis spectata virtus:
persuasum inde, licet multis difficilibusque contentionibus, Alexandro,
ut a tanto scelere abstineret, ne dirum adeo nefas perpetrando, sacro
sanguine quod (ea in gente) hactenus erat inauditum, foede adeo pol·
lueret manus. Pervenit hujus rei fama ad regem, qui primorum sen-5
tentia (quos rei indignitas plurimum commoverat) aliquot post dies
Alexandrum, ad se accitum, in vincula conjecit; reparatisque ecclesiae
Aberdonensis injuriis, Adamum omni metu levavit, quem, ut parentem
veneratus, postea inter praecipuos habuit consiliarios. Complura et
lere innumera alia relatu indigna Alexandri suasu, priusquam in vincula 10
conjiceretur a profanis quibusdam, qui regionem foedissime depopula-
bantur, perpessus est episcopus; quae omnia longius quam pro suscepto
negotio esset enarrare. Secundum haec, obtento ab rege ut Alexandri
satellites Aberdonensibus agris et praediis expellerentur, quo magis
episcopi quieta fruerentur pace, AdamuS, jam grandaevus, cum morte 15
vitam mutavit, post sacrum adeptum magistratum anno decimo,
Christianae originis nonagesimo supra millesimum ter centesimum, et
Roberti Tertii anno tertio.

forth to meet the tyrant. He offers to his vengeance his hoary and venerable
head, saying: ⁴⁸ 1f this is what you seek, here it is ’'. Many of his enemies
were moved to better feelings; nay, the bishop's splendid courage drew tears
from the spectators’ eyes. Alexander was induced after a long and heated argu·
ment to abstain from this great crime, and not foully to stain his hands with
sacred blood, a thing hitherto unheard of in that country. The story reached >
the lring's ears, and he, at the instigation of the nobles, who were much shocked
at this horriblc attempt, some days after summoned Alexander to court and
tbrew him into prison. Then, after redr'essing the wrongs of the church of
Aberdeen, he relieved Adam of all fcar, and, ever after reverencing him as
a father, treated him as one of his most trusted counsellors. Before
Alexander was oast into prison the bishop suffered many other almost count·
less indignities, too horrible to mention, at the hands of certain profane
wretches instigated by him, who in the most shameless manner continued to
waste the Church landa. To enumerate all these enormities would be in·
consistent with the object of the present work. After this, he obtained the
kings consent to have the creaturas of Alexander banished from the landa and

untes of the Church, as thus only was there a probability of the bishop
enjoying peace and quiet. Adam, now far advanced jin years, exchanged life
ior death in the tenth year aiter he had obtained his saared office, ab. 1390,
which was the third year of Robert the Third. , s ” τ’ ·
