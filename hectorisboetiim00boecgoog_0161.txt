ior death aa Tacitus gives ior suicide. Udi peregisset should beperegerat. The sub-
junctive is very rare with ubi. Horace, C. iii. 6, 41, is scarcely a case in point as
irequency is there implied, which in imitation oi Greek is found in subjunctive in
Livy and Silver Age writers, where Cicero and Caesar would use indicative.

P. 14, l 2. The caussas osDocuments relating to scotland, Vol 1. ἱ 2013, shows
that Rishop Peter was living in September, 1255, whereas Bnece gives the date oi his
death as the filth year oi Alexander ΙΙΙ., i.s., 1254

P. 14, l 5. Gruh and Keith give as the name oi this bishop Richord de Pottos.
Fordun calls him Peter de Potton. Keith thinks the name is derived from Poltos,a
markettown in Bedlordshire. Fordun says though the bishop was an Englishman
by birth he was ‘⁶ prius per sacramentum fidelitatis Scoticatus,” ia, first made a Scot
by the oath oi iealty. llis tull name occurs in a royal precept as Richoni Poitos
See Reg. Ep. Ab.. pref, xxv. Keith gives as the date ol his death 1267, while the
editor oi the Reg. puts it in 1270, prei, xxv.

Prome taxmiooiall the bishoprics ol Scotland made in the time oi Bishop
Peter, ng. Ep. Ab.. 11. p. 51, we lind the relative values oi the sees in 1256 to have
been as follows: St. Andrews, [80233 Glasgow, {40803 Argyle, gallor Galloway,
[358; Dunkeld, [12063 Brechin, ἕως Aberdeen, [16113 Dunblane, [6ης

indeed, which shows, what is otherwise sufficiently proved, that before Edward l.'s
aggression Scotland was in a most prosperous condition Aberdeen occupies thethird
placeio this list lt is not clear whether the Bishop Peter referred to in this matter
was Peter de Rsmsay, or his successor, Richard, or Peter de Potton. The Seeol
Edinburgh did not exist till the time oi Charles 1. The bishoprics ol ortney andoi
the lsles were probably at this date not considered Scottish They were regarded aa
Norwegian. The Archbishop oi Yorli also claimed supremacy over Orkney.

P. 15, l. 1. Benhyem is probablyalorm oi Benholm,acoast parish oiKincardiuo
shire. Α Thomas dc Bessum in the register oi the Abbey ol Atbroath under date sam
is designated “ Rector Scolarum de Aberdens ⁸¹. This is the first mention oi a rector
oi the school The plural scolarum is the usual torm oi this period, aad is used
probably to include the Schola Grammatico and the daug-Scissis.

Mactensie, in his Lisos, gives a long and irrelevant account ol this bishop.

P. 15,l ro. This was probably one ol the provincial meetings ot bishops, ebbots
and priors under a commater, particulars as to which will be found in Grub, Ι. poa
Lord Hailes is oi opinion that the Scottish canons preserved in the Chartularyoi

Aberdeen were promulgated at this council (anno 1268). See (laub, 1. m aod mot·

note there

P. 15,l1h See ng. spat. ior references to this bishop. Vol. 11. ot the lig..
p. 12⁶, says, “qui suffocatus fuit in lacu de Goyle ”3 and p. 247, “qui in lacu Goule
insidiis occubuit anno 1282 ”. lloece makes him die oi ‘⁸ an escess oi rheum,'' which
probably means pneumonia ending in suffocation Bishop Keith also talres suffocatus
as meaning death by natural suffocation‚ whereas the word is capable oi supporting
either the statement that he fell a victim to treachery (“ insidiis occubuit ”), ia, was
strangled, or that he died irom natural causes. Loch Goule is now known aa the
Rishop's boch, and lies east oi Parkhill railway station. See p. 8, l. 7.
