172 sirannus.

Munimenta show him, or some William Elphinstone, to have taken his degree in 1452·
Dr. Grub admits the existence oi 1 writ “which is said to refer to the bishop’s ille·

gitimacy,'' but thinks that “it refers to some canonical impediment which made the
marriage of his parents invalid or doubtful, as the law of the Church then stood''.
Dr. Grub's history was published in 1861. The Hunterian elub published in 1876 the
poetical version of the Life os stlop Elplrinstonc, by Alexander Garden. ln the Pre-
face to this work, Dr. David Laing seems to have settled the question of illegitimacy.
He gives the following documenta :-

(1) Grant by James 111, June 25, 1477, in favour oi “speciale et delecto clerico
Magistro Willelmo Elphinstone Rectore de Kirkmichael, in Artibus Magistro et in
Decretis,'’ giving him licence to dispone at any time upon his lands, tenements, etc,
“non obstante bastardia sua in qua genitus est,'' and legitimating him, “per omnia
sicut de legitimo thoro esset procreatus ''. This writ is among the papers in Cumber·
msuld House.

(2) ln 1864 there was published at Rome a worli entitled Vetera Monsmesta
Hibersorum et Scotorum Historiam illustrantia, by Father Augustinus Theiner. ln this
volume, among the “ Epistulae Alexandri,'' P. V1., there is a letter, No. 894, addressed
to Bishop Elphinstone: “Super suo praefectione, translatione ac defectu nata·
lium''. This letter, after relating that Pope SextuslV. (1471-1484) had preferred him to
the See of Roas, “teque illi prefecit in Episcopum et pastorum ac per alias tecum, ut
non obstante defectu natalium ”3 andin his translation cosbertus, no mention
having been made of this defect, in order to relieve him from any further trouble, or
risle of suspension, he, the Pope, “motu proprio, mero liberalitate,” had granted him
1 full and free dispensation, “nonobstantibus defectu et aliis premissis, etc, Datum
Rome, apud Sanctum Pettium, anno 1494, pridie idus Decembris, Pontificatus nostri,
anno tertio ’'. Pope Alexander Vl. himself was about the last person to raisea
difficulty about illegitimacy, as he was not only the father of a number of illegitimate
children, but for their salies was guilty of the greatest crimes The striking portrxit
of him given in Officers and Graduatcs shows 1 face of great power and of equally
great weskness The epigram on him given in Moreri’s Dictionary is savxge, but
probably justified by facts :-

“Vendit Alexander Claves, altaria, Christum:
Vendere jure potest, emerat ipse prius’'

“ Pope Alexander has for sale
Our Lord, the Church, the Keys,
And he is quite within his right,
He first had purchased these.''
