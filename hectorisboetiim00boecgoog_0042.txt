subiit innumeros, dioecesim pedes lustrando ne religio vel in minimo
labefactaretur; intelligens vir sanctus episcopum debere vita esse
irreprehensibilem, qui jure praeesse posset, ut prodesset non solum sibi
sed et aliis, Tandem obtento apud regem ut nemora sua de Bras et
Feterneir cum agris a venatorum injuria essent immunia (quam5
liberam forestam vulgo dicimus) anno octavo post initum munus
pontificium, diem obiit extremam, Alexandri secundi anno tricesimo.

In hujus pontilicis locum clericorum suffragiis pervenit PETRUs
DE RAMSAYO, omni disciplinarum genere eruditus Qui, inito
