mutuaque allocutione apud Pinquigniacum in Ambianorum agro, sine
alterius jactura, imo utriusque commodo, linis luerit impositus, Thomae
-magna ex parte luit opus: quod inter Jacobum Tertium et Eduardum
tot annos foedus inviolatum et pax firma permanserit, Thomae ulla sine
controversia tribuebatur. Reversus igitur, uti est dictum, Thomas ins
Scotiam, legatione feliciter acta, pace et loedere inter reges et populos
renovato, qui et privatus et publicus hactenus aliis vixerat, semper
aliena, semper maxima obiverat, jam sibi vivere cupidus Aberdoniam
concessit. Basilicam ornamentis compluribus donavit, sacris vestibus,
cappis, casulis, tunicis, Dalmaticis (ut dicunt) variis ex auro textili, 10
argenteisque vasis ad usum in sacris; praecipuum altare tabula et statuis
miri artifici adhibitis ad decorem, vestibus pendulis, et cortinis textili
ex auro, bisso, villosa, undulata, palmata. Sellas veteres in choro
lstalla dicunt) vetustate pene attritas, quibus sacerdotes ad sacra exe·

quenda sedebant, amovit. Novas mira arte et pulchritudine restituit, 15

treaties among the three kings and peoples, Thomas, who hitherto both
as a private and public person had lived for others, ever devoting himself
to unselfish and lolty causes, now eager to live so as to secure hia eternal
wallare, withdraw to Aberdeen. '

lle presented to the Church various ornamental gilts, sacred vestments,
copes, chasubles, tunics, various Dalmatica embroidered with gold, and silver
vessels lor sacred use. He adorned the high altar with a painting and statues
of wonderful artistic beauty, with hanging cloths, curtains interwoven with
gold and cambric of a raised and wavy pattern and embroidered with palm
branches. He removed the ancient seats (atalls as they are called) in the choir
which by long use were all but worn done. ln these the priests used to sitin
the discharge of their sacred duties. He put in their places new ones ol rare
art and beauty, along with a throne of equal artistic beauty lor the use ol
the bishop. He built anew the residence of the bishop, demolishing the old
turrets and battlements and erecting new ones.
