16 EPISCOPORUM ABERDONENSIUM VITAE.

vicinorum nemorum amoenitate delectatus senex sese continebat,
catarrho exundante subito interiit. ’

Et in demortui locum HENRICUS CHEIN, regius consiliarius,
Joannis Cummyni, viri inter nostrates maximae auctoritatis, Cum·
§mynorum praecipui, ex sorore nepos, est provectus. Inito Henricus
pontificatu, instaurandis templis et Dei ministris illico adjecit animum.
Vetus templum Aberdonense demolitus novum edificare incepit. Vix
jam fundamenta jecerat, quum bellico tumultu oborto, obturbatus
incepto destitit. Enimvero Anglica arma, duce Eduardo primo, regem
10 Joannem de Balliolo in Scotia bello petivere. Crescebat magis
magisque in dies id bellurn: impleverant Angli omnia rapinis et
direptionibus. Capto tandem Joanne, Londinumque misso, totam
belli vim in Robertum Brusium regni haeredem vertunt. Erant Brusio
Scotorum plurimi infensi ob caesum ab eo Joannem Cummynum, qui
15 rebus ex sententia Roberto succedentibus ad unum in Anglia exularunt.
Inter quos Henricus, qui avunculi partes contra Robertum tueri vide·
batur, est proscriptus. Eo prope temporis Brusiani Aberdonensem

To the chair of the deceased prelate HENRY CHEIN, one oi the king's
council, was promoted. He was sister's son to John Cumyn, who was one of
the most powerful of our countrymen and head of the Cumyns. Immediately
on his accession he devoted his energies to restoring the churches and im·
proving the position of the clergy. He demolished the ancient church of
Aberdeen and began to build a new one. Scarcely had he laid the inundatione
when, distracted by the outbteak of war with all its confusions, he had to desist.
For the English in arms led by Edward the First attached King John Baliol
in Scotland. The war thus occasioned every day assumed greater dimensione.
The English filled· the country with acts of rapine and plunder.

When John was at length taken prisoner and sent to London, the English
tum the whole fury ol the war on Robert Bruce, the heir to the throne. Very
many of the Scots were incensed at Bruce on account os his murder ol John
Cumyn, These to a man went into exile when the cause of Robert began to
prosper. Amongst these was Henry, who, as seeming to support the cause
ol his uncle, was proscribed.

About the same time the partisans of Bruce, greatly assisted by the
citizens ol Aberdeen, take by storm the Castle oi Aberdeen, which had, to the
great disadvantage of the Scots, been held for several years by the English.
