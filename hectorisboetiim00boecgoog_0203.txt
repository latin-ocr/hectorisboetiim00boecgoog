APPENDIX.

Hie earnest exermis,—
He walke him, and he craves
Th’ occafioun and the cause
of hie sseep, paffionat complente,
Thoughts, agonem, and thrawe
The happie youth, who knew
No nought bot to obuy,
Most docill and most deutifull
Unto his Doetours ay,
Yit with his dream, a dred‚
Made stupefeim he fears
To shaw what he suppos'd he saw.
Bashfull, a whyll sorbeam,
And modest, mutelie stayee
Attrafflng brenthe betueen3
And then the whoill he fignefeis
What, sseeping, he had sene.
Hie Meister maist humane,
Judicious and discreet,
Did presentl' apprehend these his
Perplexiteis of spreit;
And thairfor cheeflie chemin,
And him forbide to be
Ou'r carefull yit or curious
To fix felicitie,
Or to consyd into ’
Night vifiounee or dreame,
Since they of hum’roue braine be bot
superfluous extremm
And, or we wit, they grew,
So they agane ar gone;
Hersor trust not into such toyes,
Nor panse thow their upoun.
Yit tacitlie him self
On th' apparitioun pauses,
And at the ishew fine and end
0st he conceate, and skansem
Conssddring long, at last,
Quiescing dois conclood,
Into this Williame lurking lay
Things hidde‚ subleim‚ and good.
Thairefter he him self
Was marked much to be
More fllem, fad, still grave, and gevin
To tacitumitie.
