(1) The Red Friars, or Trinity Friars, located at the loot oi what is now llarket street.
Tbeir settlement in Aberdeen was due to William the Lion. (a) The Dominieaus,

P.102,1.14. Hoc temporis should be lroc tempora· manebamus-teneli-
cism The correct phrase, l think, should be codem sm usupare. lt shows Boeoe’s
carelessness asto dates, that, alter speaking ol things which happened in 1509-11, be
now goes back to 15ο7. 11 was in the latter year that Pope Julius sent the oonse'·
crated cap and swerd. Bishop Leslie tells us that they were sent becauseJameabad
sealously stamped out heresy in his country. Boece says it was because be had
abstained from war. Tytler, V. p. 29, gives a different reason: “Alarmed at the
increasing power ol the French in Italy, this pontiff had united his strength with tbat
of the Emperor Maximilian and the Venetiana to check the arms ol Louis, whiist
he now attempted to induce the Scottish monarch to desert his ancient ally. The
endeavour, however, proved fruitless. James‚ indeed, reverently received tbe papal
ambassador, gratefully accepted the consecrated cap and sword which he presented,
and loaded him and hie suite with presente. . . . But be detected the politiealfissssa
ol the warlike Julius, and remained eteady to his alliance with France.” The aword
thus sent is now amongst the Regalia in Edinburgh Castle. An account oi the
finding oi the Regalia in 1817 will be found in Ediabsrgk, ola aad Nm, 1. 71. The
sword is thus described in the document deposited with the Regalia in the crown·
room in 1707: “The sword ie in length 5 leet3 the handle and pommel are oi silver
evergilt, in length 15 inches; the pommel is round and somewhat flat on the two
aides3 the traverso or cross ol the sword, which is ol silver overgilt, is in length 17}
inches; its form it like two dolphins with their heads joining and their teila ending
in acoms; the shell is hanging down towards the point ol the sword, formed lite an
escalop flourished, or rather like a green oak leaf ; on the blade ol the mrum
tndented with gold these letters: Julius ll., P.; the scabbard is ol emmson velvet,
covered with silver wrought in philagram work into branches oi the oak tree leaves
and acoms”. The keys ol St. Peter figure prominently among the philagree work.
Alter the lall ol the Castle ol Dunottar in 1651, the belt ol the sword beram an beir-
loom in the family ol Ogilvie ol Barras, whose descendant restored it last year to the
crown authorities. A picture of the sword is given in Old aad Nm Ediabargh, Vol.
