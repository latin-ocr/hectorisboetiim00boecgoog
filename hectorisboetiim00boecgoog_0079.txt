Anglos, adhibitis custodibus, continendus. Censuere nonnulli captivum
adolescentem in Anglia continendum, donec injuriae omnes, Nortbum-
briis Scotorum crebris incursionibus illatae, repararentur, obsidibus datis
de novis deinceps non inferendis; praesertim quod Nortbumbriis
§nuper ingentem praedam, tum hominum, tum pecoris, agris abactam.
Scoto guardiano (siceum vocant magistratum) quaesti, nil aliud quam
responsum risus plenum recepere, ipsos in pecoribus, quae facile adeo
aberrare possent, spem nimiam collocasse; astutiores fore, si colendis
agris, ob nimiam Scotis vicinitatem incultiS, qui facile abigi non possent,

while he was in the hands of the English, the Scots would not dare to make
lorays into N orthumberland and Cumberland, or to carry off live stock from
these counties; whereas if he were ransomed even for a large sum and
restored to his native land, the Scots would never be quiet until they
had recouped themselves for their loss by plundering England. Many
supported this view. Others, following Thomas, held quite a different
opinion; that a promise ought to be kept even to an enemy, that the
king's passport ought by all meaos to be respected; that it was not seemly
that so great a monarch should be accused of breaking his word os honour;
and that it was not consistent with British ideas of honour to employ crastin
a struggle with any nation whatever. He said that the English had always
had many advantages over the Scots in wealth and virtue. That where the
English could not otherwise get redress for injuries, they ought to seek
revenge not by treachery, but by similar incursions and devastatione, or, il
need be, even by open war. Wherefore the Duke ol Albany ought on no ·
account to be, detained in England contrary to the king's promise. He ought
