lNTRODUCTlON.

ln seems probable that Boece was led to write the Lines of tlte

J Buhops osAbcrdeen by his admiration lor Bishop Elphinstone.

That great and good man, probably the greatest Scotsman ol
his day, and certainly one ol the most saintly‚ had so impressed
Boece with his qualities os head and heart that he resolved to
enshrine his memory in a work which should not merely give a
lile os his patron, but should show him as the greatest and the
best os a long line os saintly and learned prelates Bishop
Dunbar, indeed, is represented as a worthy successor; but
during Bishop Dunbar’s lisetime Boece could not speak os him
with the same freedom or even with the same praise that was
possible in the caseos the departed Elphinstone. lt would have
been well lor Scotland is all her prelates at this critical period
had been men like Elphinstone and Dunbar. The former
certainly had the good fortune to live in happier times than the
latter. 'Under James lV. Scotland was more prosperous and
made greater progress than it had known since the days ol
Alexander Ill. and Robert Bruce. To this prosperity Elphin-
stone contributed as much as any man in Scotland, with the
exception ol the king. Alter the battle ol F lodden‚ and the
accession ol the infant king, James V., there returned all the
evil circumstances which had distracted Scotland in the reigns
os the first three Jameses. Bishop Dunbar, like his brother·
bishop‚ the lamous Gavin Douglas, got mixed up in the struggle

between the partisans ol the queen-mother and her opponents.
