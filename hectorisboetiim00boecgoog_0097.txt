orationis primas partes accommodando, per quam unam parantur im·
peria, parta conservantur. Haec regum delectabile vinculum, haec
stabilimentum regnorum, haec pacis et tranquillitatis mater, justitiae
cultrix, misericordiae clementiaeque parens3 sine quibus uec reges

5 regnant, nec stabiliuntur imperia, nec civitates consistunt, nullus demum
publicus aut privatus sibi patriaeve aut vivere aut prodesse potest, quod
nullum bonum sit in vita quod amicitia non sit, aut amicitiae conjunctum.
Sic prisci philosophi existimavere, sic asseveraverunt divinarum atque
humanarum rerum periti: imo amicitiam rem esse divinam, nemo
10 omnium fuit qui non contenderet. Praeclare igitur Cicero exclamat:
O praeclaram sapientiam! solem e mundo tollere videntur qui amicitiam
de vita tollunt, qua nihil a diis immortalibus habemus melius, nihil
jucundius. Et Aristoteles noster perpulchre admodum: “ Nemo habens
caetera omnia bona, sine amicis expeteret vivere. Nam et locupletes
15 et in principatu potestateque constituti plurimum amicis indigere viden·
.tur. Quid enim prodest prosperitas, beneficio sublato, quod quidem
maxime fit in amicos, ac maxime commendatur; aut quonam pacto

friendship; sor that is the subject which most concems us. For by
friendship alone kingdoms are built up, and when built up, are permanently
secured. Friendship is the pleasing bond that unites kings. Friendship is
the stay of kingdoms, the mother of peace and tranquillity, the patron οῗ
justice, the parent of pity and mercy. Without these fruita oi friendship
kings cannot reign, nor govemment be established. Communities cannot
exist, nor can any one in a public or private capacity live for or beuebt

, his country: for there is no good thing in lise apart from friendship, or
which is not connected in some degree with hiendship.

“Such was the opinion oi the early philosophers. Since their time,
men skiiled in divine and human affairs have confirmed their heliel In fact,
there has never been one who has not maintained that friendship is oi divine
nature. So we firid Cicero finely declaring: ‘O divine philosophy! Tbey
seem to take the sun out of the universe, who take friendship from iiie, than
which we have no better, no more pleasant gift of the gods! Aristotle, too,
our great authority, very elegantly says: ‘No one possessing all eise that is
good would secl( to live if he wanted friends. For those that are rich and
those that arc placed in positions of authority and power seem most of all to
require friends. For what avails prosperity if the services ol others is wanting,
for these chiefly extend to friends, and lind in them their chief enhancernent?
