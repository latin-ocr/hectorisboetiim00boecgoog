regia donatione vocavit: ita homo impurus per optimi antistitis agros

videretur) sese vindicem opponere. Pontifex ubi illatas injurias frustra

to crush the bishop as he pleased. The very virtues ‘ol the latter made him
hatelul to this shameless man. He was joined by certain vile creatores, and,
pretending to be avenging his father's wrongs, he drove off all the bishop'e
cattle, and carried away his property, killing at the same time in the most high-
handed way the peasants and those who had charge of the cattle. He divided
aa he pleased the lands stolen from the church, and gave them to be cultivated
by certain wicked men who had no regard for God or man. The revenues olthe
Church known as second tithes he called his own by gift ol the king. Thus
this abandoned wretch for a long time raged without control through the lande
and estates of the worthy bishop. For no one cared to punish his insolence,
lest in so doing he might seem to offend the king. The bishop, alter he had
repeatedly complained in vain to the king ol the wrongs done him, lost all
hope oi redress, and so had recourse to excommunication, imprecating the
most terrible curses on Alexander. This had no effect, ior Alexander continued
contumacious and full of malice, and inspired by resentment and hatred tried
to surpass himself in shamelessneas. His wickedness reached its height
when, having collected a number of wicked men who instigated him to fresh
crimes, he advanced to Aberdeen intending to murder the bishop. He, know·
