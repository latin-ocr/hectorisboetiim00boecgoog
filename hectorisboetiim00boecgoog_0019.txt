Scots by bellendem Archdeacon of Moray. This translation
was made between 155ο and 1533. A poetical version of it
extending to many thousand lines was, about the same time,
composed by William Stewart‚ and was published in three
volumes in 1858. lt may be noted that a poetical version of
the Life of Elohinstone, by an Aberdeen man, Alexander
Garden, appeared in the seventeenth century. A specimen of
his version is given in the Appendirc

A second edition of Boece’s History of Scotland, with a Con·
tinuation by Ferrerius, a monk of Kinloss Abbey, appeared in
1574·

ln the Town Council Records of Aberdeen‚ under date 1528,
we find an entry to the effect that Hector Boetius, Principal of
King's College and Master in Theology, is ordered to obtain
from the Town Council a propine of one tun ol wine, when the
new wines arrive‚ or Α 20 Scots to help to buy him a bonnet.
Doubtless this gift was made in honour of his recentlypublished

history. A little before this, he was presented to the Chaplaincy
of St. Andrew's Altar, in the church of St Nicholas. ln July,
1527, a grant was made by the king to Maister Hector of an
annual pension of A 50, to be paid by the Sheriff of Aberdeen
out of the King's Casualties‚ and in July‚ 1529, there was issued
a precept for a letter to Mr. Hector Boys. Professor of Theology,
of a pension of A 50 Scots annually, until the king promoted him
toa benefice of 100 marks Scots of yearly value‚ the said pension
to be paid him by the customers of Aberdeen. ln 1555111111 15 54,
one half of the pension was paid by the king’s treasurer‚ and the
other half by the comptroller. No payment is mentioned after
1554. ln 1556, we find the king presenting Mr. John Garden
to the Rectorship of Tyrie‚ vacant by the death of Mr. Hector
Boiss. lt would thus appear that for a few years before his

death he had been Rector of Tyrie. These documents are given
in the Antiquitiss of the Shires of Aberdcen and Banff, Vol. lV.
