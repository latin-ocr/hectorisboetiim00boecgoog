P. 25, l. 16. This Alexander was the famous ⁸⁶ Wolf os Badenoch”. The
question whether he was illegitimate or not turns on the nature ol the relationship
existing between King Robert 11. and Elisabeth More, daughter ol Sir Adam More
ol Rowallan There seems little doubt that she was his wife; Robert 111.,here1desr
son, who ¹succeeded his lather, could hardly have done so had he been illegitimate.
ll the eldest son was legitimate. the youngest must have been so. See Ruddiman's
Introduction to Anderson's Diplomala. The “Woll's ¹’ treatment oi the neighbour-
ing Bishop ol Moray and his buming of Elgin Cathedral in 1390 are better known
than his dealings with the Bishop ol Aberdeen. In the Reg. Ep. Ah, pp. 13⁶7·
will be lound under date 1382 an account ol how the Bishop oi Aberdeen had to
call in the secular arm to get rid oi an invasion of the Church lands in Birse by
the Macintoshes. These may have been instigated hythe ‘⁸ Wolf ”. He had an
illegitimate son who followed in the lootsteps ol his father, and distinguished himself
by a raid across the hills which separate Aberdeenshire from Foriarshire. Tytler
calls the son Duncan‚ while Hill Burton calls him Alexander. .

P. 26, l h “Second tithes.'' The learned editor ol the Reg. Ep. Ah, prelace‚
p. xxxiv.. thus explains the nature oi these: “These dues are everywhere described ss
consisting ola tenth ol the thanagia, reditus elsim (or rents and dues payable by the
thanes and tenants ol the king’s demesne lands); atenth of the casualties ol superiority
(or the revenue levied from crown vassalo for ward, relies, marriage and non-entry);
snd ol the escheats‚ linea and whole issues ol the king's coorta-as well in burgh as
to lond-within that district The right ol the bishops ol Aberdeen to these is con·
firmed by royal charters dating almost from the foundation ol the See’' interesting ⁶
questions io connection with the Church lands emerged in Bishop Adam‘s period ol
office. For an account oi these the reader may refer to the Reg. Ep. Ah, preiace,
pp. xxxia, xxxin.

P. 27· l. 17. Boece is wrong here, 1390 being the first, not the third year ol the
reign ol Robert 111. ‚

P. zu, l. 6. The sentence beginning Imprimis isan anacoluthon.

llill Burton (Histosy os Scotland, Vol 111. p. 80) says about 1400 the English king.
ttemy, began his reign with a grandinvasion ol Scotland. He msrched with alarge
lorce ss lar aa Leith. Rothesay was then acting as Governor os Edinburgh Castle,
which held out stoutly and effectually against the English. Albany, who commandeda
large army s few miles distant, did not offer battle, and it hasbeen suspected that he
would have had no objection to see Edinburgh Castle fall into the hands os the English,
ii,thereby, his nephew should be killed ortaken prisoner. 1 can tind no other authority
but Eoece's for the statement that Bishop Greenlavl caused the siege oi Edinburgh '
Csstle to be raised atthis time. In his history Boece gives the impression that this
invasion by King Henry was a mere pretence on his part, and that he was actuated
by kindly leelings towards the Scots. lt may be noted that Boece seems to represent
the invasion by Henry as taking place shortly after Greenlaw's appointment to the
