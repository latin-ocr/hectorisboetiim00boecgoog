112 EPISCOPORUM ABERDONENSIUM VITAE·

Aberdonensium querela. De Wilhelmo nihil dubitandum, quin, ob
amplissimas virtutes, ob sanctissima in vita gesta, piumque in Deum et
homines affectum, ad divam virginem, cui se adolescens devoverat, et
cui tota serviverat vita, quam templis, si licet dicere, decoraverat, quam·

founder.

After the death of Bishop Elphinstone, on the day appointed for the

election of his successor, the Earl of Huntly, a rich nobleman, unexpectedly
appeared in the meeting of the canons, entreating them to appoint as bishop
