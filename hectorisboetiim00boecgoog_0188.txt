ornamus, makes him Rector after 1516. Doubtless he is right, but Boece’s use of
elassieal language to describe post-classieal offices makes it difficult, spart from
other information, to identify certain offiees. The Latin would seem to indicate that
he was a professor of some kind. ChamberS, in his Biograplticol Didionary os Eminonl
Sootsmen, makes him the first teaehcr of scholastic theology in the University.

lt took its name (Geel, ‘⁴ head chureh ”) from the lact that six subordinate churches
belonged to its parsonage. lt is now included partly in the parish of Keithhsll,

P. 92, l. a. Alexander Gelloway was the architeet of the Bridgsof Dee. He
(according to Dempster) wrote a book on the nature of the Hebrides, and of the clag·
gesse, and the trees on which they grow. This is one of the fables given to the world
by Boece in his History of Scotland. Galloway was Rector of the University in 1516,
1511, 153ο, and 1549. See Anderson's Offiursand Graduous, p. 7.

P. oo, l. 5. John Lindsay: in Fasti, p. lxxx„ is given ss Canonist before Arthur

in Officers arrd marmus, shows that these two, along with Henry Spittall, were not
Canonists, but holders of the Readership in Canon Low, conjoined with the prebend
