Another work, to form part of the issue for 1893, is-

lV.—Tnn Ruconns or Anovur„ Edited by the Most
llon. the Marquis of Huntly‚ LL.D. Upwards of
350 pages of this volume have been already printed
off, including all the Deeds selected from the Aboyne
Charter Chest; but the unexpected accumulation in
the editor’s hands of material illustrating the early
history of the Gordons and of Aboyne before it
came into the possession of that family, has delayed
the appearance of the book. The last of the MS. is
now in the printer's hands. The volume will be
richly illustrated with photogravure portraits of
the early Marquises of Huntly‚ views of Aboyne
Castle as it appeared in the seventeenth century, and
plates of seals never before engraved.

As the number of pages to which ll. and lV. have run has
very considerably exceeded the estimate formed a year ago, it
has been found impracticable to include in the financial year,
1893, the third volume mentioned in the Sixth Report, viz. .·-—

V.-Bonca’s Lrvns or rna B1suors or Annonam. Edited
and translated by James Moir, LL.D. This will
therefore fall to be reckoned as part of the issue for
1894, and as the whole of the Text and Translation
has been printed off, and the N otes are now passing
through the press, subscribers will have the satisfac·
tion of receiving an instalment of next year's publi-
cations in an early month.

As approved by the Editorial Comrnittee, the other volume
to appear in 1894 will be—

Vl.—Hrsron1cnn Auo orum< Plenus conuncruu wrrn rna
Jacomrn anon. Edited by Colonel Allardyce. Ι
