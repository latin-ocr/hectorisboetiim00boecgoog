patrem, utilemque pastorem. Neque arbitrentur se aliurn pontificem
adeptos, si non qui post episcopum Wilhelmum secundus collegio con·
ditor esset futurus. Haec de eo sentirent; fore haud dubie ut haec in
eo experirentur.

Secundum haec, soluta concione domum undique est concessum.5
Postridie cum venisset Gavinus pontifex in collegium, singulas ejus aedes
revisit, sacra vasa et ornamenta: ad suos inde conversus, Haec (inquit)
optimi olim pontificis Wilhelmi desiderium mihi haud sine dolore reuo-
varunt. Hunc enim his aedibus, quocunque me verto, animo, hunc
oculis, requiro. ,Libuit tandem Wilhelmi episcopi sepulchrum videre, ro
oed vidisse poenituit. Est enirn locus tapetibus stratus, nullo adhuc
decenti monumento ornatus. Subiit illico pontificis animum indignatio
cum miseratione, tanti viri reliquias neglectas, sine nomine, sine celebri
monumento, jacere, cujus memoria tantam orbis partem pervagatur.
Et abiens, Heu (inquit) tam raram in amicis fidem; tam paratam 15
oblivionem mortuor'um. Rebus itaque nostris consulemus viventes ;,
mortui amicorum memon’a cito excessuri. Cui non timenda haec

let them think that they had got a new hishop‚ even if he were not destined to
be the second founder of the University. This was the light in which they
must regard him. Assuredly, experience would show that his desire was to
he to thern all that he had said.

Alter these speeches the meeting hroke up and all returned honre. On
the following day Bishop Gavin paid a visit to the various buildings of the
Univemity and examined the sacred vessels aad ornaments. Theo, turning to
his friends, he said: ⁴⁴ The sight of these things but renews my grief for good
Bishop William. For, wherever 1 turn my steps, my mind thinks of him; my
eyes miss his well-known figure.” He desired at length to see his last
restim-plum but when he saw it the sight pained him. For the place
is covered with carpets, and as yet has no suitable monument The hishop
was at once filled with pity and indignation that the remains of so grenta
uren should lie neglected, without a name or any monument to celebrate one
whose fame extends over a great part of the world. As he departsd, he
cried: ‘⁶ Alss that faithfulness should be so rare among friends, that the dead
should be so reedily forgotten. We shall therefore consult our own interests
while alive, seeing that when dead we shall so soon fade from the memory of our
friends. Who must not lear this wrong which before our eyes has befalleu ,
