nvos 01² THE BlSlfOPS OF ABERDBEN. 37

aedificiis et ornamentis, hominum animos optimis disciplinis et moribus,
semper est annixus. Moritur tandem, his atque aliis multis gestis in·
signis, posteaquam septemdecim annos tenuerat pontificatum, et Jacobi
regis Secundi anno vicesimo secundo. Dum ejus funus efferretur, Aber-
donenses cives et matronae probiores, per dolorem lachrymantes cadaver 5
magna veneratione sunt deosculatae: tanta Ingeramum et vivum et
mortuum reverentia prosequebantur. Humatur in choro Aberdonensis
basilicae, ubi moles ejus, curn effigie lapidi artificiose satis insculpta,
celebrem in viri memoriam postea per amicos est exstructa.

THOMAS inde SPENS, antiqua ejus gentis ex familia, Aberdo· 10
nensem pontificatum est adeptus, vir incredibili prudentia; quod con·
tinuata in eum benevolentia regum, varia nonnunquam sentientium (ut
sequentia docebunt) apte demonstrat. EratThomas acri semper [ingenio]
et ad magna gerenda accommodato. Hunc privatum Jacobus Secundus
praecipuos habuit inter amicos: donatoque Gallovidiano archidiaconatu, 15
simul atque Lincloudana ecclesiastica praefectura, ad Carolum Septi-
mum, Francorum regem, mittit oratorem, ad nonnulla quae ad utriusque

decoratione, the minds of men by the highest moral training. At length he
died, having gained an illustrious name for these and many other causes,
after he had held office for seventeen years, and in the twenty-second year of
James the Second. When his obsequies were being performed, the townsfolk
of Aberdeen and the respectable women wept for grief and warmly kissed with
deep reverence his dead body. Such was the reverence they showed to lngram
both alive and dead. He was buried in the choir of the cathedral, where his
monument, with an effigy cut in stone with considerable skill, was afterwards
erected by his friends to commemorate his memory.

After him, THOMAS SPENS, a scion of one of the branches of that
ancient race, and a man of rare sagacity, succeeded to the bishopric. That he
continued to enjoy, like his predecessors, the good-will of successive kings,
however much these might differ from each other in policy, will be clearly
shown by his subsequent history. Thomas was a man of keen intellectual
power, and well suited for the conduct of large enterprises. Even when in a
private capacityhe was treated by James the Second as one of hia chief
” friends. The king presented him to the Archdeanery of Galloway, giving
him at the same time the provostehip of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden.
