canonicorum et regni majorum auctoritate, Sancti Andreae archi-
episcopus designatus, renuit tantum fastigium constanter, Aberdonensi

episcopatu contentus. Quum enim tanta magnifice adeo ageret, ut viri
opera cunetis haberentur pro miraculo, nunquam tamen abbatiam
5 aliamve ecclesiasticam praefecturam (ut nunc plerique) commendatione
est adeptus. Aberdoniam se contulit, in pontis chorique conditione,
quorum loco haud multum distanti mentionem fecimus, atque aliis piis
operibus reliquum vitae consumpturus. Cupiebat optimus pater (modo
dedissent fata) Aberdoniae, ubi primaria ei sedes, tranquilla quiete atque
to otio, quod multo meruerat labore, vitam sancte et composite finire.
Sed revocatus ad regni primores, quod suborta inter eos dissidia absque
ejus praesentia sedari non poterant, ab incepto destitit. Profectionem
dissuadebant amici (jam enim aegrotare coeperat) verum illis respondit,
se non solum sibi natum, sedet patriae, plusque reipublicae quam suae

devote the rest of his days to the construction of the bridge and the choir
of the cathedral (these we mentioned a little above), as well as to other
pious works. It was the wish of our worthy father (had his destiuy so
allowed) to end bis days at Aberdeen, the soene of his first settlemeat,
in that holy tranquillity and quiet which he had so well deserved by
his many labours. But being recalled to meet the nobles, beesuoe dis·
sensions had broken out amongst them which could not be settled except by
his presence, he gave up his design. His friends dissuaded him from going,
for he was now ill, buthe replied that he was born not for himself only but
for his country, and that he owed more to the state than to his own safety;
and would not be prevented by the state of his healtb nor any one's museum
from undertaking the joumey. Accordingly, setting out in poor uentu,
about half-way on his joumey his fever incressed and he stopped at Dunferm-
line. After he had been confined to bed there for some days, he made his will,
leaving all his gold and silver and whatever furniture he had to complete
