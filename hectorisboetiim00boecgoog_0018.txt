writer until Spenser’s time, Scotland produced james l., Henry·
son and Dunbar, all possessed of the true poetic gift. Besides
these there were Blind Harry, Douglas and Lindsay. But in
the period which followed the reign of James lV., and which
extended down to the time of Allan Ramsay, with the single
exception perhaps of Drummond of Hawthornden‚ there was no
Scots writer of first-rate power who condescended to write in
Scots or English. Boece‚ Major, Buchanan‚ Arthur Johnston,
and the minor poets of the day, all wrote in Latin. Hence it
follows that not the least interesting feature of a work like the
present is the study of its Latinity. The writer puts into his
Latin the graces of composition which would otherwise have
appeared in the vemacular. ln the case of Latin, especially at
the period when Boece wrote, this involved a close imitation of
the style of Cicero or Livy, or of both. ln consideration of this
fact, l have criticised our first Principal's Latinity in no cen·
sorious spirit, but simply because having chosen such a medium,
and thereby appealed to readers possessed of the power of
criticism. he lays himself open to be · judged by a different
standard than if he had been less ambitious.

Press, by lodocus Badius. lt was, with the exception of John
Major's Ha'rtmy of Greater Britain, published in 1521, the first
attempt, apart from scholastic and theologica} works‚ on the
part of a Scotsman to appeal through Latin to a wider audience
than Britain provided. Boece’s Hr'story os Scotland was pul>
lished in 1527. Before the appearance of these two histories of

Scotland, there had been no history of the country in print
Fordun and Wyntoun had written chronicles, copies of which
in MS. more or less perfect existed in some of the monas·
teries ln order to give a wider circulation to Boece’s History
