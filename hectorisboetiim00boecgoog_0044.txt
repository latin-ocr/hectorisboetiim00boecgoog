limo DE BEN HYEM was by the votes ol the canons appointed in his

place. He immediately after his assumption of office went to Rome, where by
the orders ol Pope Martin the Fourth (who was then the occupant of the Chair
ol Peter) he was consecrated bishop. After spendingayear in Rome for religious
purposes he returned to Scotland. 'At that time the people of Scotland hap·
pened to be at variance with the clergy, the latter supporting their views by
quoting the decrees of the popes, the former by bringing forward the use and
wont ol the kingdom. It is said that the quarrel arose from the people openly
refusing to pay tithes ol certain crops, which the priests demanded. Hugh
was commissioned to settle the dispute. A meeting ol notables was held at
Perth, where, after a long and eamest discussion in the presence ol the king
and the nobles, the old ordinances ol the bishops (usually known as provincial
decrees) were by his efforts confirmed. He added, with the approval ol all
present, certain new decrees which had for their object the honour and ad·
vancement ol the Christian religion. The quarrel between the people and
clergy he completely removed and extinguished. Many other acts did he per-
form worthy ol an excellent bishop. His term of office reached to the twenty-
ninth year ol Alexander the Third. In that year he suddenly died of an excess
os rheum in the island ol the lake ol Gowllis‚ where the old man found sucb
delight in the pleasant groves adjoining that he sought no other retreat.
