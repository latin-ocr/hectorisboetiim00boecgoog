ann01232. See Keith, p. 106.

P. ra, l 7. Radulph, or Randolph or Ralph, is called further De Lambley.
Keith mentions several deeds where his narne occurs. The following is from Bishop

¹Leslie, p. 217: “Eadem aetas protulit Rodulphum quendam prudentia insignem,
sanctitate admirabilem,auctoritate primo Abbatem AberbrothaeumAEpiscopum deinde
Aberdonensem; qui ita utramque et religiosi et Episcopi viam in omni postea vita
tuebatur, ut dubites plane, fueritne diligentior Episcopus, an arctior religiosus Nam
etsi dioecesim summis exhaustis laboribus obierit, ut clerum intra officii sui terminos
contineret, populumque in rectam vitae rationem induceret, tamen tenuiori veste
Episcopus quam Abbas, duriori parsimonia dives quam pauper, arctiori regula Magia·
tratus quam privatus semper vixit Unde Alexandro sanctissimo regi um fuit in
intimis, ut Ecclesiam Abetdonensem et fundo opimo et aliis donis lautissimis ejus
causa amplificarit’'-“ The same age (the reign of William the Lion) produced one
Rodulph, a man of notable wisdom and wondrous piety. lle held the position first
of abbot of Arbroath (this abbey was founded by King William the Lion in honour of
Thomas i Bechet, with whom in his youth, according to Leslie, he had been very
intimate) and afterwards of Bishop of Aberdeen. He throughout his whole career so
observed the duties of a religious and of a bishop, that one might well wonder whether
he was more energetic as a bishop or strict as a religious. For although with the
greatest labour he traversed his diocese in order to keep his clergy within the bounds
of their duty and to induce the laity to lead a proper life, he yet ever lived as bishop
in simpler apparel than he had used as abbot, with sterner frugality when rich than
when poor, with stricter observance of monastic rulo when in supreme power than
when he was a private individual. Hence he was on so intimate terma with pious
King Alexander (11. i) that that king for his salte bestowed a rich estate and other .
precisus gifts on the church of Aberdeen.”

P. ra, l. 16. Rdigiosa vita probably meana the life of a religious.

P. 12, l. 16, etc. In preface to Rog. Ep. Ab. will be found notice of several deeds
where Ralph's name occurs. Others will be found in Bishop Keith's Lines. Fordun
calls him vir magun bonumir, ix. 62.

P. 13, l. 10. Dr. Grub, 1. 334, says with regard to this: ‘·‘ The bishop, with
consent of the dean and chapter, promulgated a body of -statutes ior the govemment
of his cathedral This is the earliest record which we possess regarding the consti·
tution of the chapter of Abetdeen. The bishop himself wasone of thirteen unone,
and in that capacity was subordinate to the dean. Eut his powers otherwise were
extensive, all the prebendaries being appointed by him except the dean, who was
chosen by the chapter.'' ng. Ep. Ab, ll. pp. 3850, and preface, pp. lum-lxxvii.
Bishop Ramsay ia styled by Fordun vir nobili ortus prosapia et clara malm aientia.
In preface to Reg. Ep. Ab. he is said to have obtained a Papal rescript fixing the
stipend of the incumbent of each vicarage at hfieen merlis. He was appointed one of
the young lting’s councillors in the settlement of the Government Bishop Keith gives
various references to him.
