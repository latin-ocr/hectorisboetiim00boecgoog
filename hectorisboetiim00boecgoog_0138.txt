quoque Wilhelmus idem occurrit. Adolescens enim, juvenis, omni deni·
que aetate, se totum virtuti accommodavit: verbum turpitudinis, per·
inde atque turpitudinem ipsam, semper detestatus; mulierum congressum
et publicus et privatus obhorruit. Salutiferae Christi passionis frequenti
delectabatur commemoratione, de qua solitus erat et docte et pie con-5
cionari, atque noctem quam sancta dies Veneris est secuta, cilicium iu·
dutus, piis precibus ducere insomnem. Dulce nornen Iesu nunquam
excidit animo, quod die ac nocte, vigilans aut experrectus, semper habuit
in ore. Miseris et afflictis quovismodo adeo compatiens, ut eorum in·
commoda lachrymis prosequeretur. Objecti criminis poenitentes si· 10
quando vidisset, ut benignus, haud durus pater, dulci affatu, lachrymans
frequentius, monuit viverent studiose, scelus per voluptatem non ad·
mitterent; quo effectum ut plerique praesulis non tam auctoritate quam
benevolentia moverentur ad meliora. Wilhelmi mortem secuta publica
moestitia. Aberdonenses enim et cives et matronae, simul curn clero, 15
eum ut parentem diu luxerunt, querentes Aberdonense decus cum eo
cecidisse, eoque mortuo ipsorum neminem non fore infelicem. Haec

william as such an one. For in every period of his life, as youth and man,
he devoted himself wholly to the cause of virtue He even detested the word
indecency as much as indecency itself. The company of women he avoided
both in public and in private. He found delight in the frequent commemora·
tion of Christ's saving sufferings, a topic on which he used to discourse with
much learning and devoutness. The night before Good Friday he spent in
prayer, clsd in sackcloth, without closing an eye. The sweet name of Jesus
was never absent from his thoughts, and day and night, sleeping or waiting,
was ever on his lips. His sympathy with those that were in misery or any
affliction was so great, that he relieyed their distresses with tears. If ever
he saw any sorry for the sins charged against thern, lilre a kind, not a
relentless father, with gentle words and oltener with tears, he exhorted
them to live carefully and not to be guilty of sin through love of
plessure3 the result being that many were induced to lead a better life,

not so much hythe authority as by the kindness of the bishop. The
bishop’s death was the cause of universal grief. For the citizens of

Aberdeen, as well as the women, along with the clergy, long mourned
for him as for a father, saying, sadly, that with him had perislred tlte
glory of aberdeen, and all their happiness had expired witb him soen
