videns expugnatas captasque, Anglos vix caede temperantes, Stephano
Albaniae ducem in patriam celocibus vehi, et quis ipse esset, aperuit,

doubtless hoped for a great reward, as he had captured and brought before
the king so formidable an enemy. Little did he know how dear Thomas had
become to the king on account of his recent services.

Not many days after he reached Westminster‚ and after thrusting the
other captives into prison he brought the Duke of Albany and Thomas
before the king. “ Behold, your gracidus Majesty,'’ said Stephon, “Thomas
the destroyer of the Earl of Warwick and of many English nobles, the cause
of rebellion, many ware, and evils almost countless in this realm of yours.
