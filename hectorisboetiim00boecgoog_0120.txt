nunc praedicatorum fratrum intra Scotorum regnum summum (quem
provincialatum dicunt) agit magistratum: is pio et religioso animo
exempli locum meretur inter primos sui instituti. Indigne siquidem
ferens sacram praedicatorum religionem neglectam inter nostros adeo
ut pene contemptui daretur, non maris pericula horrens, non aemulorum 5
soevitiam, minas, injurias, non laboribus, non corpori parcens, duram
admodum subiens provinciam ut labefactata repararetur, magnis et
incredibilibus obtinuit laboribus; effectumque ut nunc eruditi, pii, et
religiosi, qui sacras literas enarrant, profitentur, concionantur, illius
instituti viri frequentes inter nos reperiantur: quae omnia Joannis piis10
sudoribus ulla sine controversia accepta sunt ferenda. Ad haec Wil-
helmi auctoritas, qui et domi et foris plurimum potuit, haud parum
conduxit. Hos nominavimus ut praecipuos qui Aberdonensi eschola
prodiere. Alios haud ignorans transeo; plures enim sunt quam hic
locus, ut enarrentur, exposcit ; etad institutum redeo. Wilhelmus15

Priueipal of the Friar Preachers (ia, Dominicans) in the Realm of Scotlaud
(Provincial being his proper title). He, by his pious and holy life, pre-
erninently deserves the place of exemplar to his order. And this is ⁸03 since,
indeed, feeling indignant that the sacred duties of the Friar Preachers were so
neglected in our country as to have almost passed into contempt, he dreaded
uot the dangers of the deep, nor the fierce fury of rivals, no threats, no out·
reges, sparing no exertion nor his bodily strength, and persevered in great aud
- incredible efforts while he traversed his very rough province in order that the
tottering fabric of religion might be restored. And the result of his labours
vae that there are now found among us many men of that order, lamed,
pioue and religious, who expound the Scriptures, take the triple vows ofa
moult and preach. Without the possibility of controversy all these happy
results must be credited to the pious exertions of John Adam. The personal
iuduence of Bishop William, who had very grem power at home aud abroed,
contributed not a little to bring about this happy state of affairs. We heve
mentioned these by name as the chief products of the University in its early
deys. Others l pass by, though not ignorant of their merits. For they are too
numerous to receive a place in this narrative. Now l retum to my theme
Bishop William was so pleased with the first-fruita of his school that, in
order to put it on a firmer basis, he founded a College magnificent in respect
of the beuuty and extent of its buildings, and worthy of everlasting fame. Iu
