Jam quae Wilhelmi vita, et qualis ipse luerit, et privatus et pub
licus, brevius quam res expostulet monstravimus, ut cum omnis com·
mendatio e vita nascatur, quae vivens gesserit, laudis gloria virum
dignum ostendant. Quod siquem laudandum putamus, qui multa

5 honeste coniecerit, maximis in rebus cum laude summa luerit versatus,

Ι occurrit nobis wilhelmus, qui industria magnarum rerum conficienda·
mm pene omnes suae aetatis superavit. Si quidem eum extollendum
censuerimus, qui Dei venerationem templis aedificandis aliisque piis
operibus instauraverit, Christianae religionis ritus restituerit abolitos,
¹0 hominum compescuerit peccata, doctrinam sanctam coluerit, et ad Dei
cultum doctorum auxerit numerum, Wilhelmus quoque occurrit nobis3

id etenim viri acta, quae communem hominum facultatem longissime

and as having played a most distinguished part in wider spheres of aedom
Bishop William at once occurs to us3 for he may be said'to have eur·
passed all his compeers in his devotion to works oi public utility. Ii we
think that a man should be extolled, who, by building churcbes and by other
pious works, increases the reverence of (iod, restores the abandoned riter
oi worship, restrains wiclredness, is the patron oi sacred learning aud
increases the number oi learned men devoted to the service ol God, tbe mine
ol Bishop William occurs to ua as pre-eminentIy worthy oi such praise. For
the deeds oi the man, aa to the best oi our poor ability we bave shown, so tar

Δ surpaesed the ordinary efforts of men, that they prove my eontention more
clearly than the light oi day. Finally, ii we consider any one wortby oi
immortality ior virtues, or for anything more excellent than virtue, lor
anything which exhibita an innocent youth, an illustrious manhood, a
