infinitorum hoc tuo in regno incendium; qui ut Anglorum optimates
atque plebeii a tua fide delicerent, ut imperio dejicereris, quantum per
eum fieri potuit, semper extitit auctor, meus est captivus, pro quo tot
aliquando aureorum nummum millia spopondisti. Sume nunc tua pro

astu intulerit et fraude, nec me (ut aequum est credere) promissa mer·
cede, qui infestum adeo tibi hominem captum et vinctum adduxerim,
fraudabis. Habes et Albaniae ducem captivum, regium adolescentem,
Scotorum principem, quem dum ‘penes te retinue'ris, hoc tuum regnum
10 omni Scotorum bellico tumultu incursionibusque levabis. idcirco cave
(modo tibi tuoque regno optime consultum volueris) aliquando Scoti
reducem hunc videant adolescentem. Eduardus, ut erat vultu liberali,

my safety. Wherefore 1 can easily forget the plote of many conspiratura
