P. 73, l. 11. KingJames was not destined to secure even for himself peace. He
might control the Highlanders‚ but he could not contend against the disorders occa·
sioned by the leudal system. Although Scotland had no “Wars of the Roses,” it
yet had in the reign of James ΙΙΙ., as well as before and after that reign, constant
disturbance from the turbulence of the nobles. England‚ by its civil war, must have
affected both Scotland and Prance. At all events we find in all three countries at
this time that the kingly power was constantly threatened by individual nobles, who
we resupported by other nobles, while the kings had only to a very small extent
the support of the burghs and non-feudal population. The Wars of the Roses,
for instance, were carried on almost entirely by the nobles and their-retainers.

James 111. would seem in many respecta to have been in advance of bis
time. Like all the Stuart kings‚ and more particularly his grandfather and his
aon, he possessed distinct ability. Hence his patronage of Cochrane and such like
men.

P. 74, ly Appellitabal: this is alate Latin word. The force of it is not given
in the translation, ‘⁴ He made a point of frequently so styling him,” ks, dearest
brother.

P. 74,L 14 Grub says, 1. 405: “Some of our writers referto his appointment
as Archdeacon of Argyll in 1479, but the William Elphinstone who held that office
appears to have been a different person from the bishop. He was nominated to the
See of Ross by King James 111, and is styled elect and confirmed of that diocese in
blarch,1482. In November, 1483, he is styled Bishop of Aberdeen.'’ The preface
to the Reg. Ep. Ab.. p. xliv, shows that he was on May 17, 1484, still styled Bishop of
Rosa There is thus a slight discrepancy between Grub and the editor of the
Regianum, but it may be explained by the fact that the delay was occasioned by the
taking of steps to get over hia illegitimacy. Boece seems to say that he never acted
as Bishop of Roas, because the patron saint ol its cathedral was not the virgin blary.
But in the capacity ol “Electus confirmatus Rossensis” he was one of the Lords
Auditors of complaints, May 17, 1484; Reg. Ep. Ab.. pref, p. xliv.

P. 75, l. 1. The ng. Ep. Ab.. pref, p. xliv, says: ‘⁸ He sat constantly during the
year 1484 as a Lord of Council '’.

P. 75, l. 4 Libidine: Tytler‚ 1v. 256, says: “The aspersione, indeed, which
were so unaparingly poured on the inemory of this monarch by the lection which
dethroned and destroyed him, and the certain falsehood of some of their most
confident accusatione, render the stories of his alienation from the queen, and his'
attachment to other women, extremely doubtful Avaritia: there is nothing to
show that James 111. was of a rapacious character. His lot was cast in most
troublous times. In other lands also kings had atthis time a severe struggle to keep
their thrones. The nobles seem to have been ever ready to form coalitions among
themselves against the king. As showing the feelings with which the death of
james 111. was regarded in Aberdeen, the following extract from the Bergk Rcoords
is most valuable and interesting. It is a fair inference that Bishop Elphinstone may
have had considerable intluence in getting such a minute put on record :-
