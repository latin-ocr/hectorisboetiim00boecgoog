P. 23, l. 11. optimis quibusque, the more classical construction is optim pauper.

P. 24, l. 4. The Epistulam (Reg. Ep. Ab, Il. 248) says: “Qui primus templi
hujus fundamenta jecit ’'. See also Il. 59, where, ior the restoration nithe cathedral,
the bishop resigna all the second tithes, with the revenues ol St. Nicholas’ cunei
(except its nahing), and the chapter obliges itsell to pay to the Master oi Works the

‚ nave. A number ol interesting references to the bishop will be lound in the prefioe

P. 24, l. rc lt is not easy (possiblei) to identily this embassy. In 1371Wsrd·
law, Bishop oi Glasgow, Sir Archibald Douglas, and Tynninghame, Dean oi aberdeen,
concluded a treaty with the French king at Vincennes. Tytler, 111. 8. In 1371tbe
English were very lar indeed from holding the position in Prsnce which the lilack
Prince had gained some hlteen years before. Boece’s stat'ement that they sese
victoriously harassing town and country is inaccurate. The ng. Bp. Ab.. preisoe,
p. xxxi.. shows that in 1375 the bishop was abroad; but by that time the English
under John ol Ghent had been reduced to great straits, and were glad to make s nuce,
so that the impression conveyed by Boece’s statement, that the Scottish ambassadots
went to France to help the' French in their distress, is not justified by iacta. blase·
over, Boece makes the bishop die within a year ol his return ‘from this embassy.
'l'he Reg. Ep. Ab.. Vol. 11. p. 248, fiaes the date ol his death as July 29, 238ος ιο that,
according to Boece, the date ol the embassy must have been about ¹37⁹ As ι matter
oi lact, aiter the death ‘ol Edward 111. in 1376, the English ior a considerable number
oi years were too much engaged with domestic troubles, such aa the Peasants’ War
and the teaching ol Wiclii and his lollowers, to be able to send armies to Pranoe.
