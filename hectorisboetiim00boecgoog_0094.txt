veneratione est affectus. Dubia quaedam ardua pontificii juris, publica
concione proposita, gravissima et prope extemporanea oratione ita
patefecit, ut antistitem simul et Glasguensem clerum in admirationem
traheret. Ergo quod eruditione polleret, ingenio esset perspicacis

quae tum amplissima erat, et non nisi eruditissimis tributa potestas.
Hanc Wilhelmus mira dexteritate administravit; justitiae excultor,
calumnias litigantium coercens, bonorum extortoribus, legum contor-

Bonis nocet, qui malis parcit. . Hoc pacto fundamenta jecit futurae

Canon Law, propounded to him in a public assembly, he explained in a speech
cf great weight, delivered almost cx tempore, with such clearness as to elicit
tbe admiration both of the Bishop and the clergy of Glasgow. Accordingly,
be was appointed to the office of Episcopal Judge in the Diocese of Glasgow‚a
dignity &stowed only on men of the greatest learning, and at that time regarded
aa a high honour. The reasons assigned for his selection were his profound
eruditiori, his clear intellect, and his great eloquence. He discharged his
dutiee with wonderful address, conserving justice, restraining calumnious
litigation, and never sparing extortioners or perverters of the law. This
maxim was ever on his lips: ‘⁶ He hurts the good who spares the bad '’. By
such conduct he laid the foundation of his future greatness.

But so bright a light could not be concealed beneath a bushel; his fame
could not be confined within the limits of the Diocese of Glasgow. He was
summoned to Edinburgh by King James and the nobles of the kingdom, in
orderto give them the benefit of his advice on various difficult questions. There
be discharged with success the office of Episcopal Judge in the Diocese of St.
Andrews. Not long after, he was made one of his majesty's privy councillors.
In this position he ever behaved with a most scrupulous regard to equity and
rigbteouaness. Nothing in his eyes was expedient which could justly seem to
any one dishonourable. His reputation became wide-spread, and his advice
was sought on matters requiring the greatest deliberation. His judicia!

decisione gained universal approval.
