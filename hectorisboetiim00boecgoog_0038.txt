nota few of his own. Edward was the first to establish in connection with
the church at Aberdeen men of a holy order (he called them canons) as con·
freres for the discharge of sacred rites along with the chaplains. He died
thereaftcr when he had completed his eleventh year of office.

Not long after, in the eleventh year of the aforesaid King Malcolm‚ ab.
1163, MATTHEW, Archdeacon of St. Andrews, a man whose whole life,
religion and learning were pre-eminent, obtained the Bishopric of Aberdeen.
When the good king learned his prudence in the conduct of great affairs, his
efforts to obtain due observance of religious rites and his faithful services to
God and man, he recognised in him a kindred soul and ever revered him as
his father and teacher. After confirming under his own hand the gifts of his
ancestors to the church of Aberdeen, he unreservedly bestowed in honour of
God, the holy Virgin and St. Machar (in honour of all of whom the church
then began to be built), as well as of Bishop Matthew‚ the lands of Tuligreg,
Fetyrneir, Owyn, Invercroudan, Banquhore Denif and Bahelny, along with
their ecclesiastical revenues, as well as those of the parish church of the town

of Aberdeen. Charters of the king conveying these granta are extant. T his
