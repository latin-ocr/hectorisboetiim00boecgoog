nores. · 169

P. 118, l. 7. Reuerentiam. This is like paternitas, a few lines before.

This extraordinary metaphor we have had before (p. 32, l. 8). Horace, C. l. 23,
8, has el corde et gruibus tremit.

P. 118, l. 14. What follows must, l fear, be regarded as Bathos.

P. 118, l. 17. Before quod there should be sed.

P. 118, l. 19. Superpositus is a sort of pun, as the vane is placed over the build-
ing, so the bishop is placed over the church.

P. 119, l. 1. Dum with subjunctive, meaning “while,'' we had before (p. 113,
l. 16).

P. 120, l. 8. Habes should be 12 habere.

P. 120, l. 15. Iniit should be sc iniisse.

P. 120, l. 11. Vidisse should rather be uidere.

P. 121, l. 1. This passage seems to mean that if he should not prove a second
founder of the University, he at least would strive to be like its founder, Elphinstone.

P. 121, l. 3. Dc eo should bedese ipso.

P. 121, l. 11. lt is sad to think that even now, when the quater-centenary of the
foundation of the University is about to be celebrated, and when, one would think,
the founder in some way should obtain honour, no proposal has been made to cover
his remains witha monument adequate to his merits. Bishop Dunbar's tomb, too,
is exposed to the elements, and unless protected from their violence will soon lose its
exquisite beauty.

Adescription of Bishop Elphinstone's tomb as it was before it was mutilated
will be found in Dr. Norman Maepherson's Monograph on King's college.

P. 122,l. 5. conditio in this usage belongs to Ecclesiasticsl Latin. ln the
Classic period the word belongs to condio, not condo, and signilies seasoning,
flavouring.

P. 122, l. 8. Cupido should be cupiditas. Ut should be quo.

P. 122, l. 15, For some notes on the Bridge of Dee, see Appendix.
