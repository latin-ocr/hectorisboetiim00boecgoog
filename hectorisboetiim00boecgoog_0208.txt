APPENDIX E.

lt may be interesting to give bere the charter granted by James 1v. to Walter
Chepman and Andrew Myllar to set up a preas in Scotland. ch. Sec. sig.. 111. 129.

James, etc. To all and sundry, our officere, lieges and subjecta whom it cou-
cems, to whose knowledge these our letters shall come, greeting. Know ye that, ior·
asmuch as our loved servants, Walter Chepman and Andrew Myllar, burgenses ol our
burgh ol Bdinburglt, have at our instance and request, lor our pleasure and the
honour and profit ol our realm and lieges, taken on them to iurnish and bring home
a prees (prent), with all stuli belonging thereto, and expert men to use the same, lor
imprinting within our realm oi the books ol our lawa, Acts ol Parliament, chronicles,
mass books and portuus (aa, the Breviary) aiter the use ol our realm, with additions
and legends ol' Scottish saints now gathered to be eked thereto, and all other books
that shall be seen necessary, and to sell the same lor competent prices, by our
advice and discretim, their labours and expenses being considered; and because we
understand that this cannot be lurnished without right great eost, labour and ex·
penses, we have granted and promised to them, that they shall not be hurt nor
presented therein by any others to take copies ol any books iorth ol our realm to
cause print the same in other countriea. to be brought and sold again within our
realm, to cauae the said Walter and Andrew lose their great labour aud expensea:
and also it is deviaed and thought expedient by ua and our council, that in time
coming mass books, manuale, matin books and portuus books, alter our own Scots
use (in, ritual), and with legends ol Scots saints, as are now gathered and eked by
the reverend father in God and our trusty councillor, Williarn, Bishop ol Aberdeen,
and others, be used generally within all our realm as soon as the same may be
printed and provided: and that no manner ol such books ol Salisbury use be brought
to be sold within our realm in time coming.

Bishop Leslie, p. 296, says: “ Hoc tempore ars Typorum, quam Impressoriam
dicimus, in civitate Metensi jam. primum in lucem a Germano quodam missa est,
majorine compendio an dispendio rei literariae aliorum sit judicio ''.

‘⁴ At this time (1458) the art ol using types, which we call printing, was first given
to the world in the city oi Metz by a certain German. Whether this discovery is a
greater advantage or loss to literature 1 leave others to decide.”

Bishop Elphinstone had evidently no seara on this score, but much-happened
betwun his time and Leslie's. Had there been no heretical works published in the
interim, bestie might have given a more distinct pronounsement.
