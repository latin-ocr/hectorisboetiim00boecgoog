Rosnsrsow, LL.D., 1891.

P. 7⁰· ‘⁸ We owe the cathedrale of Aberdeen, Fortrose, Lismore and Edinburgh,
to the Middle Pointed or Decorsted period, which extends from the death of
Alexander 111. to the Reformation.”

P. 74. “The larger (then Rosemarkie or Fortrose) but less ornate cathedra! ol
st. M‘achar et Aberdeen was begun in 1366. The Desn and Chapter-Barbour, the
venerable poet of the Bruce‚ being one of the dignitaries-taxed themselves lor the
fabric in Sirty Pounds annually for ten years; the bishop surrendered certain revenoes
which were worthprobably twice that sum, and the Pope in 1380 made a liberal grant
of indulgences to all the faithful who should stretch forth a helping arm to the work
But all these appliances availed only to raise the foundations of the nave a few feet
above the ground. Forty years passed before Bishop Henry Leighton (14²²·144⁰)
reared the two western towers, completed the wall of the nave, and founded the
northern hensept His successor, Bishop Lindsay(1441·1459),paved and roofed the
edifice. It was glezed by Bishop Speos (¹459·1430)· The pious Elphinstone (1487-
1514l-'one of those prelates who in their munificent acts and their laborious snd
seintly lives showed to the Scottish Church, in her corruption and decey, the glorious
image of her youth-built the great centrel tower and wooden spire, provided the great
bells end covered the roofs of nave, alsles and transept with lead. Bishop Gavin Dun-
bar(1519·1531)—e meet successor to Elphinstone-built the southern transept, sod
gave to the nave the flat ceiling of panelled oslr which still remains, with its eight
and forty shields glittering with the heraldries of the Pope, the Emperor, St llar-
garet, the Kings and Princes of Christendom, the Bishops and Earls of Scotlsnd.
The Choir seems never to have been finished, and of the transepts only the founda-
tions now remaln. The nave is nearly perfect, and its western front, built of the
obdurate granite of the country, is stately rn the severe symmetry of its simple
design.’'
