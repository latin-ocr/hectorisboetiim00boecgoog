174 ursanum.

This Alexander Gardyne, or Garden, is the author of three other works :-

(ι) Α Gardcn os Grave and Godle's Flevum, smne, Elegies aad Empta Plsnted‚
Polished and Perfected by Mr. Alexander Gardyne. Et sacer ct maguus Vatum labor.
Edinburgh‚ printed by Thomas Finlason, 1609„ With Licence.

(2) The Theatra os the Scottish Kings, by Alexander Garden, Professor of Philo-

sophy at Aberdeen. Done from the original manuscript, Edinburgh, Printed by
James Watson‚ and sold at his shop, next door to the Red Lyon‚ opposite to the
Lulren-booths, 1709. Both these poetical works have been published by the Abbots·
ford Club, being'edited by William Barclay Turnbull, advocate.

(3) A Theatra os Scottislv Worthies. No printed copy of this worlr was known to
exist, when in 1876 the Hunterian Club printed it from a manuscript in the libraryof
the late Sir Alexander Boswell of Auchinleclr. David Lsing was editor, and he gave
in the same volume the metrical Life os Bithop Elphinstonc‚ by Garden.

The Alexander Garden who wrote these works seems to have been the father of
Alexander Garden who was one of, the Regents of King's college. See Officers aad
Graduatca p. 55. The son was afterwards minister of Forgue‚ and lived to 1677.
The poet seems to have been an advocate in Aberdeen. His name will be found in
a document published in Kennedy's Annals os Aberdeem Vol. 11. p. 166. T hough he
is styled “Professor of Philosophy” in the title-page of the Theatra os tlu Scottislr
Kivgs, the manuscript of this work, according to Laing‚ “furnishes no such state·
ment”. These poems are written in a style of such bathos, that one can hardly
imagine that two poets of the name of Garden‚ both Aberdonians, and living in
succession, could have perpetrated such doggerel.

The following may be talren as a specimen ol Garden's poetry. They are the
opening lines of the poem :—
