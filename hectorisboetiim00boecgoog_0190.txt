NOTES.

P. 98, l. 11. Cujus should be dequo.

P. 99, l. 1. Caenuntum is in the first edition sementum, a misprint.

P. 99, l. 3. Elphinstone's historical works are now in the Bodleian Library.
They consist mainly of a transcript of Pordun. See the Introductory Dedication to
Bisbop Dunbar for the statement that Edward 1. destroyed the national documenta of
Scotland.

P. 99, l. 12. Utcunque: this should be qualibuscunque. He refers to his History.

P. 99, l. 14 Egregie egerim: ie.. by their actions.

P. 99, l. 15. This refers to the publication of the Aberdeen Breviary. Cosmo
lona, Preface to Reg. Ep. Ab, says: ‘⁴ ln the Breviary os aberdeen, so interesting as
a specimen of the earliest Scotch printing, he has left an invaluable memorial of the
ritca of the ancient Church. The part appropriated to the legenda, applicabis to
particular Saints' days, embodies much Scotch ecclesiastical history, mixed with
some notices of civil affairs of remote antiquity, founded on ancient written memoirs
of the planters of Christianity in Scotland, now for the most part lost, but enough of
its materiale remain to establish the general faithfulneaa of the compilation.” Only
ι four copies of the original edition now exist. A reprint was published in 1854 by
hlr. James Toovey, bookseller, London, under the editorship of the Rev. William
BIew, M.A. A full account of the work ¹will be found in Dickson and Edmond'a
Αιιιιαζι os Scottialr Priutiug. lt is not the least of Bishop Elphinstone’s claime to
honour, that he was the means of inducing King James to encourage Chepman to
undertake the publication of the Breviary. The Breviury was not the first book
published in scotland, but the printing press was set a·going in the first place for its
introduction. The two volumen of the Breviary were published in 1509, 1510. There
had previously been published some of Dunbar and Henryson’s poema, as well as the

Romunce os Gologras aud Gawae'u. Blind llary'a Wattaee also seems to have been
published about 1508. At least David Laing thought ao, forming his opinion from a
few pages of the Wallaee which were found in the binding of a first edition of Gologras
and Gamaiu. lt isto be hoped that the New Spalding ctub will bs able to produce
aa, ite magum opus an edition of the Breviary.

P. roo, l. 1. This is, l think, quite untrue, especially the statement that the

English altered the ritual of the Scottish Church. Blind Hary, Χ. 1001, says that ,
the Sarum use was introduced in Edward'a time. It can be shown that the Surum
use was observed in Scotland long before Edward's time. The whole question is
discussed by Father Thomas lnnes. See Spalding Club Misellum, Vol. 11. p. 3⁶4·

P. 100, l. 5. Ut nihil should be nequid, as purpose, not result, ia implied.

P. roo, l. 7. Boece seems quite satisfied with the way in which the good bishop
gave lands and ecclesiastical offices to his ltinsmen. This sort of favouritism was a
distinctive feature of the age. Pope Alexander Vl. shrunk from no crime in order to
advance his children. The Dulce of Rosa, brother of James 1v., had been made
Archbishop of St. Andrews, and the lting's illegitimate son, Alexander, succeeded him
before he had reached hia majority. On Elphinstone's death, the Earl of Huntly
obtained the bishopric for a kinaman.

P. 100, l. ¹4· Plumae. Cp. Juvenal, Vl. 88: ‘⁴ ln pluma paterna dormire”.
