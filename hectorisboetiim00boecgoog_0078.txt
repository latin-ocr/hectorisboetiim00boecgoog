meam servasset salutem: propterea insidiarum multorum, ejus fortasse
praecipua opera, in meum caput regnumque olim paratarum (quorum

bus meam meique regni salutem credidi, periissem insidiis. Ne mireris
idcirco si hunc (quem hostiliter aliquando persecutus sum) nunc cle·
mentia hortante, quod regum more ad ignoscendum quarn ulciscendum
propensior esse debe0, benignius amplector. Enimvero huic viro non

Some gave it aa their opinion that the captive prince should be kept in
England till all the wrongs done to the people of Northumberland by the
frequent raids oi the Scots should be redressed, and hostages given that
these should not afterwards be repeated. They were the more urgent on this
