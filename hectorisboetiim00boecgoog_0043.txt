5 Extincto Petro, RlCHARDUS DE POTTOCK Aberdonenssi
creatur antistes; Anglus gente. Quae res effecit ut montani de Cloueth
et Murthlac, pontifici, veluti homini peregrino, minus audientes, agros
et praedia multa subtraxerint, famulis ejus verberibus caesis et igno-
miniose repulsis. Tulit Richardus aegre contumeliam, execratus

sceleris insimulati restitutis praediis venissent Abeidoniam, ad an·

mountaineers ol Cloveth and Murthlac to be less obedient to him as being an
alien and to seize in many cases part ol his lands and buildings, at the same
time beating his servants and driving thern off in an ignominious manner.
This insuit Richard greatly resented. He proceeded to excommunicate them.
The king himself would have appeared to punish their crimes, had they not
speedily restored the property, confessing unfeignedly their guilt. Nay, they
carne to Aberdeen, and falling at the bishop¹s feet with many tears offered to
suffer whatever punishment he might choose to inflict. So they obtained

- pardon. Richard died in the thirteenth year of office, and in the eighteenth
year of the aforesaid Alexander. He confirmed anew to the churcb ol Aber-
deen, with the sanction ol Alexander, the gifts of his predecessore.
