Professor Duncan, who died about 1820, having been up in
London, brought with him on his return this picture, which none
of the Senatus could discover any reason lor supposing to be,
what he thought it, a portrait os Boece,-but to please the donor,
it was allowed to be hung up, and on his death was not removed.
lt is gradually acquiring a repute os genuineness from the assiduity
with which it has been engraved and titled as ‘from the original
in King's College ’.”

The Rev. Dr. Milne, the Manse‚ Fyvie, tells me there is a
local tradition that Boece was Rector oi Fyvie. Os this l can
find no confirmation, but l think the names, Fyvie and Tyrie,
have been confused, as they would look very like each other in
ancient script. ls it be said that Fyvie was more likely, as being
a richer living than Tyrie, to have been given to Boece, 1 would
remark that Tyrie in Boece’s time included what is now the
parish ol Pitsligo. Dr. Dickson os H.M.'s Register Office has
been good enough to examine specially the deed in which Tyrie
is mentioned He says: “The writing is good and legible‚ and
there is not a shadow os excuse sor reading the word ‘Fivy ' ”.

This is not the place to attempt an estimate of the value os
Boece as a historian. lt may suffice to say that while he is
pictoresque he is unscientific; that his History of the Bithops
shows the same deiects as his larger work, the Hrlrtovy of
Scotland,· that he seldom gives dates and never quotes autho-
rities; and that except lor contemporaneous events he cannot be
regarded asa trustworthy authority. He speaks os authorities
for his History, Veremundus (tempore Malcolm lll.), and a
certain Campbell, both os whom are otherwise unknown. Le·
land’s tetrastich on Boece is as follows 2-—

“ Hectoris historici tot quot mendacia scripsit
Si vis ut numerem, lector amice, tibi,

Me jubeas etiam fluctus numerare marinos
Et liquidi stellas commemorare poli.''
