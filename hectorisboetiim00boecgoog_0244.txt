lt is expected that the second volume of the Musa Latina
Aberdonensis, containing the remaining works of Arthur John-
ston, will be ready sor issue by the early months of 1895.

For the second volume of the Fasti of Marischal College‚

on which the Secretary is engaged, Dr. Alexander Cruickshank , ’

has presented a photogravure of Watson Gordon's portrait of
his father, the late Professor John Cruickshank; and Dr. Joseph
Ogilvie has presented a photogravure of Cassie's portrait of Dr.
Melvin. The Council gratefully acknowledge these gists, which
will tend greatly to enhance the value of the volume, and to
stimulate a like generosity in others.

Thanks are also due to ΜΓ. W. Kendall Burnett‚ who has
printed and presented to the Club a very elaborate genealogical
chart of the Burnett Family, drawn up by himself, for insertion
in the volume begun by his late uncle the Lyon King of Arms

A satisfactory advance is reported by Dr. Walter Gregor in
connection with his promised volume on Folk Lore; and by ΜΓ.
James Maedonald in connection with his on Place Names

Professor Trail hopes to have the David Skene Papers in
readiness for publication at no distant date; and the Rev, Mr.
Forbes-Leith continues to accumulate material illustrative of the
Diary of the Scots College at Douai.

The selections from the Presbytery Records of Alford by
the Rev. Thomas Bell, lx'eig, and from the Synod Records of
Moray hythe Rev. Stephen Ree, Boharm, are also in progress
Mr. Ree proposes to add to his volume a Fasti 0f all Parochial
Schoolmastcrs within the bounds of the Synod from the earliest
extant dates down to the passing of the Education Act in 1872.
Such a list may, it is hoped‚ be the precursor of a Fasti Scholae
Scolicanae worthy to rank with the great work of Hew Scott.

Since the last report was submitted by the Council, thirteen

members of the Club have died: ΜΓ. Alexander Grigor Allan,
