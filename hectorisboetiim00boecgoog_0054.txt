Posteaquam Alexander fatis concesserat, ADAM DE TYNNIN·
GAMME, vir nobilis, plurimaeque inter suos auctoritatis, Aberdoiren·
sem iniit pontificatum. Erat is Roberto regi familiaris, et, singularem
ob prudentiam, morumque candorem, et ingenii ubertatem, regni pa-
tribus acceptus, adeo ut, quoties arduum aliquid in consultationem5
adduceretur, ejus sententia in primis apud eos valeret. Legationes
complures ad Francorum regem, et privatus et publicus, pro utri·
usque regni felicitate obivit. Veteres foederis conditiones firmavit,
novas quasdam, utriusque regis auctoritate, superaddidit. Legationi-
bus feliciter perfunctus, cum publicis negotiis totus insisteret, obtrecta· 10
torum et delatorum quorundam malitia, Roberto regi suspectus esse
coepit, ne in ferenda lege super regum successione cum optimatibus
quibusdam (quibus lex ea displicuit) sentiret. Ipse vero Adamus‚ sua
innocentia fretus, ut regem suspicione levaret, Aberdoniam adiit, ibi,

was so dear to the counsellors of state, that as often as any difficult question
came before them in consultation his opinion thereon had with them the
greatest weight. He discharged the duties of ambassador to the King of
Franoe on several occasions, both in a public and a private capacity, to the
advantage of both natione. He confirmed the terms of the ancient league,
and added certain new ones on the authority of both princes. After discharging
successfully his duties aa ambassador, while he was devoting his whole energies
to public business he fell under the suspicion of the king: for owing to the malice
of certain detractore from his fair fame and of busybodies who carried tales to
the king’s ear he was accused of sympathising with the views of certain leading
rnen in the country on the question of the succession to the throne. This
matter came up in connection with the passing of a law on the succession,
which these nobles disapproved of. Adam, himself confident in his inno-
cence, in order to remove the suspicions of the kingwent to Aberdeen, intending,
