Rus, etc: Keith (Bbhopr) says Kirkmichael was iu the city of Glasgow. This
can hardly have been the case. Dr. J. F. S. Gordon, the learned author of Glaeglsa
Facies, assures me there never was a Church of St Michael in the city of Glasgow.
lfrnd an altarage of that saint in the lligh Church mentioned several times in
Matrimonia Unio. Gtasg. but that is all. Keith says the bishop's father was the
first Rector of Kirltmichael, and aftenvards Archdeacon of ‘leviotdale Thia atate·

Elphinstone‚ who appears in the recordo aa parson of Kirkmichael, was not the arch
deacon but the bishop himself

P. 62, l. d Was his illegitimacy the reason why he was advised to go abroadl
Lapse of time and fame gained in foreign lands would do much to efface the stain
on his birth, which his own stainless character would otherwise bave consigned to
oblivion, but for what now-sdays we call red-tape, and but for that malice which ever
seelts to slander merit which it cannot otherwise asssil. The phrase pascal perenibus
wadum seems to indicate that there was something unsatisfactory in the relationship
between him and his parents. A man old enough to be parson of Kirlrmichael could
hardly be said to have his career affected by proximity to his parents, unless there
was something unusual iu the relationship. lt is interesting to note that the famous
Erasmus, the contemporary of Elphinstone‚ was an illegitimate son. His father
afterwards took holy orders, after the mother of Erasmus was dead Some think that
Elphinstone’s father in like manner took orders late in lite, having been engaged iu
business when his son William was born.
