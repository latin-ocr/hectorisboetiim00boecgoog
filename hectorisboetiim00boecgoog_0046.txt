arcem, quam aliquot annis maximo cum Scotorum incommodo Angli
tenuerant, Aberdonensibus plurimum suppetiarum afferentibus, expug-
natam vi capiunt, caesis qui ejus custodiae fuerant destinati; ac paulo
post ne Anglis ullum Aberdoniae superesset refugium, omni supellectili
exhaustam solo aequarunt. Angli amissae arcis caesorumque contri-5
bulium tristi nuncio affecti, coactis copiis Aberdoniam movent anin'ro ac-
ceptaminjuriam ulciscendi. Id ubiAberdoniae nunciatum,Brusiani simul
cum civibus illico oppido egressi sunt, cum hostibus dimicaturi. Joannes
Frisarius Brusiani exercitus, qui tum Aberdoniae fuerat, dux suis ita
animos accendit ad pugnam ut non tam ad certamen quam ad certam 10
victoriam progredi viderentur. Inita pugna acerrime est certatum. ” ·
Victoria tandem (sed cruenta) Scotis cessit: Anglorum quamplurimi eo
praelio caesi, pauci vivi capti, rari fugere, adeo acriter in pugna perdu-
rarunt. Placuit victoribus quos captos habebant ad terrorem extra Ι
oppidum furca suspendere: sed vetuere canonici, atque ut caesorum 15
corpora ad posticam templi divi Nicolai terra conderentur, apud
Frisarium atque oppidi praefectum obtinuerunt, ubi eorum ossa cum
titulis in rei monumentum adhuc cernuntur. Sed revertamur unde

They put to death those who had been appointed its garrison. Shortly alter,
in order to leave no place of refuge for the English in Aberdeen, they remove
all the fittings and level the castle with the ground. The English, deeply
moved by the sad news of the loss of the castle and the death ol their country·
men, assemble their forces and move towards Aberdeen eager to avenge the
loss they had sustained. When these tidings reached Aberdeen the supporters
of Bruce, along with the citizens, at once marched forth to join battle with the
enemy. John Fraser, commender of Bruce's army in Aberdeen, inflamed his
followers with such ardour that they seemed to be advancing not so much to
battle as to certain victory. Aliercely contested battle ensued. Victory at
length (though bought with much bloodshed) declared for the Scots. Of the
English the great majority were slain, very few being taken alive. Small
bodies only escaped here and there, so obstinate was their resistance.

1t was the wish of the victors to hang their prisoners on a forle-shaped
gallowa outside the town in order to terrily others, but the canons forbade this.
They aleo obtained the permission of Fraser and the provost of the town to
bury the bodies of the slain Englishmen at the postern gate of the church of
St. Nicholaa. There to this day may be seen, in testimony of what l say, their

bones along with inscriptions. But let us return to the thread of our narrative.
