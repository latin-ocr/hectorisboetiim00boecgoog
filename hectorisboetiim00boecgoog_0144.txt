gratiae (optime Deus) qui pastorem Aberdonensi gregi tot tantisque
virtutibus coruscantem dedisti, qui non solum ex omnibus eligi, et ab
omnibus debuerit approbari, verum omnibus veneran', omnibus anteponi
jure meruerit. Sed ne assentandi notam incurramus, a qua optimus
quisque plurimum abhorreret, tuas amplissimas laudes tacebimus, quas 5
enarrare perinde esset atque immensi caeli singulas connumerare stellas.
Et duo tamen munera quam brevissime obire conabimur. In priore si-
quidem tibi tuoque adventui gratulabimur, devota offerentes obsequia;
in altero exactissime orabimus, praelato generali collegio, quod felicis
memoriae Wilhelmus tuus antecessor modestiae causa regale voluit 10
appellari, ejusque vicinarum quoque aedium ad scholasticorum usum
consummationi, tua pro dignitate consulas. Quantum nobis omnes
gavisi sumus, quantas Deo optimo gratias habuimus, praesul semper
venerande, quum laetissimum nuntium accepimus, te sacrae Aberdon·
ensis sedis episcopum designatum, verbis explicare nequimus; quippe 15
tum novimus insignem nobis moderatorem delectum, qui si quid
incommodi turbulento hoc tempore indigne passi luimus, id omne scite
atque prudenter rependet, literatos tuebitur, fovebit, excolet. Extemplo

Aberdeen, as pastor, one gleaming with so many great virtues, one who not
only ought to have been chosen before all and approved of by all, but who
also deserved to be revered by all and preferred to all. But, lest we incur the
charge oi flattery, from which all good men would be free, we shall be silent as
to thy great praises, which to rehearse would be a task as great as to name each
of the stars in the vast finnament. Two duties we shall endeavour as brielly
as possible to discharge: in the first place we congratulate thee on thy arrival,
offering at the same time our devout respects; in the second we pray thee
most eamestly, in accordance with thy dignity, to consult the interests ol
tbe mommid University, which thy predecessor, Bishop William, of blessed
memory, from modesty, wished to be called King's College, and to finish the
buildings in its neighbourhood for the use of its members. How glad we all
were, what thanlrs we gave to the good God, everto be revered bishop, when
we heard the most glad tidings that thou hadst been selected our bishop, we
cannot express in words. For we then knew that a distinguished ruler had·
been chosen lor us, who, il we have suffered any loss or indignity in these
uoubled times, will, with slrill and prudence, compensate us lor all, and will
protect, cherish and advance the cause ol learning. At once, on account ol
these tidings,a public meeting was called and we returned thanlrs 'to God.
