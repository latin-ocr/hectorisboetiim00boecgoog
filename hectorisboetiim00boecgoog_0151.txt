Palladii socii, quibua has legavimus aeder,
Extarent animi quae monumenta mei,

Vos oolui vivens, inter vos mens mea vixit,
Vos carum duxi semper habere meos3

Et memini vestri vivens, post fataque dura
Immemorem vestri reddere Parca nequit.

Et ne aliquid nostri vestrum desideret ullus,
Hanc animam in coelis ossa tenetis humi.

Qui nostrorum igitur soli nostri remanetis,
Sic memorem vestri me redamate patrem.

And do ye that are left alone os ua return my fatherly love which ever ·
