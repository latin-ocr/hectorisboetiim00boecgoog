NOTES.

Preface, p. i., l. 5. Fergus 11.. accor'ding to Bishop Leslie (pp ras-127), lived
about 420 a.n., and was a contemporary of St. Ninian. lle drove the Romans out
of scotland. Having for long been a man of war, he at last gained victory and
peace, and then devoted his energies to the advancement of religion and culture.
He liberally endowed the clergy, and, in particular, founded the Abbacy of lona

Preface, p. i., l. 6, Britons'bus. This clearly means those inhabitants of Britain Α
who were under the Roman yoke, im, probably those south of the Roman wall
between the Firths of Forth and Clyde. That this is the meaning of the word is
proved by the fact that Leslie, referring to this expulsion, uses the words, Romanis
paleis Sestos in libertatem asseruit.

Preface, p. i., l. 7. The note on l. 5 shows that Boece is not alone in saying
that lona obtained at least additional pre-eminence in the time of Fergue. llollins-
head says, p. 81 ι ‘¹ This Perguae was present with the Gotthee (under Alaric) at the
winning of Rome, in the eaclrlng whereof, amongst other epoiles, he got (as ie
reported) a certelne cheat full of booles, the which some hold opinion he brought
afterwards into the Westemenlsles, and caused them to be liept in lona, now Colme·
kill, within a librarie there builded for the same intent Which boolres (as ie to be
supposed) were certeine historiee or monuments of old antiquities. But the same were

eo defaced in the daies of Hector Boetius (who, as he himself writeth, caused them to ·

be brought over to him to Abirdine), that it could not be understood of what matter
they intreated” .

Hollinshead (ha, Boece) tells us, p. 182, that Alexander 1. chanced to come to
lona, and through “violent rage of westher. was eonstreined to abide there three
daiea, and because he found some reliefe of meate and drinke by meanes of an hermit
that dwelt within the same lnch, and kept a chapell there dedicated to Saint Colme,
he made of that chapell an Abbeie of regular Canons,” etc.

Preface‚ p. i., l. 14. Restennet Priory is near the town of Forfar. Aefarasl
ean aee, there ie no reason to think that the literary treasures of lona were transferred
to Restennet. The existence of these boolrs is denied by Father Thomas lnnea

Prefaee, p. i., l. ις. Quia is in the first edition quo, which seems an error.
