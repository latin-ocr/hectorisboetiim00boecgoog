usus, honorandum senem ut parentem· veneratus, aetatis imbecillitati

Galloway, Alexander Vaus,'a noble and learned man, who was then Bishop
of Whithorn, greatly exerting himself in his interest. To Vaus he always
diaplayed the attention due to a most reverend man, showing respect to that
venerable and aged man aa to a parent, and· doing his best, as far aa
circumstances theo allowed, to remedy the defecta due to his aged patron's
feeble health. ln the presence of his aged friend he never suffered himself to
be styled either bishop or lord. Any service which he might have rendered
either to Galloway or hia native land generally, and which proved successful,
he ascribed not to his own efforts, but to the sagacity and initiative of hia
venerable patrum He appointed to guard him by night and day the most
careful attendants, leat any one might say that the slightest harm had
befallen him from causes other than those due to the otherwise inevitable
weakm of old age. When Bishop Vaus at last died of utter old age, and
weary of life, Thomas spared no expense in giving him afuneral worthy of
the beat and most saintly bishopa

After he had trained the people of the See of Galloway to holy life and
munera, and had been, on the call of the canons, transferred to the Bishopric
of Aberdeen, that no service which gratitude might claim might be wanting, he,
with great efforts and expense, obtained appointments for four of the kinsmen

of the deceased old man, one being made Bishop of Galloway, another Prior

of Whithom, a third Abbot of Tungland, and a fourth Abbot of Saulseat.
