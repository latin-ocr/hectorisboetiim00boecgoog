148 worss.

pp. 309·31o The office dated from 1225, and cameto an end in 1472, when the
Bishop of St. Andrews was raised to the rank of Metropolitan and Primate. As
conservator Bishop Spens preaided at a provincial Council held at Perth in 1459
Bishop Spens played a large part in the history of his time. Materiale for tracing
his career will be found in Reg. Ep. Ab, pp. xl.·xli., and in Keith’s Bishopr.

P. 55,1. 15 Concione is not appropriate, as it implies a general meeting, nota
meeting, as here, of magnates Egerat, a line or two above, should rather be egisset.

Ρ. 56, l. 3. Brassa is Birse on Deeside.

P. 57, l. 3. Primulibus from primas is very late Latin.

P. 57, l. 6. Apparitores: the word is perhaps used here for the provostmarsbal
and his attendants. The rapidity, however, with which “Bell the Cat ’³ and the other
nobles acted on this occasion is hardly consistent with the employment of public
servants. ln Tytler's History, Vol. IV. pp. 231-235, 34⁶·34s will be found an attempt
to estimate correctly'the cause of the rebellion of the nobles against James 111. The
real cause seems to have been a secret treaty made between Edward IV. of England
and Albany, the king's brother, the object of which was to dethrone James and place
Albany on the Scottish throne. All the ancient Scottish historiam were completely
ignorant of this treaty, which will be found in Rymer's Foedera, Vol. xn. p. 156.

P. 57, l. 8. Laqueis, etc: the translation given is not elegant, but perhaps no
other words would eaactly bring out the meaning.

P. 57, l. ro Bishop Blacader, by withdrawing the gift of the second tithes granted
by his predecessor for repairing the church, provolred the anger of the burgessea,
which found expression in the following resolution of the burghers: “ 7th November,
1481. The aldirman, counsel, and communitie of the burgh ol Abirdene, the com·
munitie gadrit throw the waming of the belman, ryply and weill aviait, with ane

ln the above extract the word firmas is for finitam, and denotes the aclanowledg·
ment of duty to a superior, or an actor deed indicating such subjection. See sim,
firmare in Migne's Low Latin Dictionary. ln English writers, Migne says. the word
denotes a feast, or repast, ‘⁴ convivium et omnia mensae apparatus '’. lt ia interesting
to note (1) that in 1481 the chief magistrate was called Aldermant (2) that the
biahopric is called Aberdon not Aberdeen Would it be saleto suppose that at thir
date Old Aberdeen was called Aberdoni
