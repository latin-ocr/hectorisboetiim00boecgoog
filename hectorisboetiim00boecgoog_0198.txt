The name Elphinstone, or Elphinston, seems to be of English origin. Aris, or
eis, in Anglo·Saxon, denotes an elf, ing is a patronymic termination denoting sorr,
while trin signifies an enclosure, a house surrounded by its lands or grounds. Thus
’ the first who bore the name of Elfing would have been regarded as the son of an elf ·
or sorite. His habitat would be known as Effingstun, and in course of time sorne one,
not necessarily a descendant of the fairy’s son, would obtain the territorial sumame
of deElfinstorr, and would be, according to the old Scots style, ‘¹ Effinston of that ilk ''.
The ruins of Elphinstone tower stand in Tranent parish, and belong to the fourteenth
or fifteenth century. The whole district of Lothian must be regarded in historical tirnes
. asEnglish,not Celtic. Names likeHaddington,Tyninghame, Whittingharne, Lething·
ton, Athelstaneford, Dirleton, Mothanr, Ormiston, all point to an English occupatiori.
The Elphinstone family was ennobled in the reign of James lv, receiving at the same
time the Lordship of Kildrumrny. (charters may be seen in Antiquitr'es os Aberdeerr-
stin, Vol. IV. p. 217, Spalding Club.) The father of the bishop seems to have been
William Elphinstone, a cadet of this house, who was in holy orders. He was Rector
of Kirkrnichael, and Archdeacon of Teviotdale. Crawfurd, in his Officers os State, p.
47, says the bishop was the son of william, third son of Sir Williarn de Elphinstone
of that ills This son of Sir William, according to Crawfurd, after he became a
widower entered into holy orders. Bishop Keith follows Crawfurd in this account
of the parentage of the bishop.

Dr. Grub, l. 403, thinks that the bishop's father never was a cleric, but was all
his life a layrnan. He thinks that all the references to William Elphinstone a cleric
are to the son, not to the father. These references are found in Munimenta Ahu
Universitatis Glasguensis, and unquestionably point to the existence of at least two
william Elphinstones who were in holy orders. For instance, there is a notice of a
canon of Glasgow of that name as early as 1451· Now the bishop seems to have been
horn in ¹43¹· He could hardly have been a canon at twenty years of age, as these
