30 EPISCOPORUM ABERDONENSIUM VITAE.

noster legatus a gubernatore atque magistratibus ad Carolum, qui regern
consolaretur, et certiorem faceret, eos qui Galliam adjuverant, et totius

the only instance (as our annale show) when the league between our nation and
France, similarly renewed, was ratified by the loss of many Scottish lives.

brothers (of whom we have spoken) in that disastrous battle in France.
Murdac, Robert's son, had succeeded to his father's inheritance as well as
