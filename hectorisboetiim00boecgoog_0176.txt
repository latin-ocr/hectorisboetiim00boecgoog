dreediul death is ascribed by Buchsnen to hie oppressive treetment ol hie veeeele;
see Buchenan, XI. 2⁵· Pitscottie gives the following account ol the deeth oi Biehop
Cemeroo: “ On Yule·Even, when he wes sleeping, there come e thuoder end e voice
lrom heeven crying end summoning him to the extreme judgment ol God, where he
ehould give anacreontem reckoning of all his cruel offences without further deley.

Through this he wekened lorth oi his sleep, end took leer ol the novelty oi euch
thinge unknown to him before3 but yet he believed thie to be no other but e dreem,
end no true werning for emendment of his cursed lise: yet he called lor hie chember·
chiele, end caused them to light condies, end to remein e while beside him, till he
recovered the seer end dreedour thet he hsd taken in hie sleep end dreeming. But
by he hed taken e book and reed a little while, the seme voice end words were heerd
with no less leur end dreedour then wes before, which mede th'em thet were preeent
et thet time about him to be in dread, eo thet none of them herl e word to epeek to
enother, thinking no less then sudden mischiel hestily to belel them ell; end, from
bend. the third time, the seme words were more ugsomely tried then before. This
biehop rendered his spirit hestily et the pleeeure ol (lod, end ehot out hie tongue
most wildly, se he hed been henged upon e gallows, e terrible sight to ell cruel
oppressore end morderem of the poor.’' Il the cherecter of Bishop Cemeron wee
enything like whet this horrid scene would justiiy, he could herdly heve teken delight
io the innocent prettle of young Elphinstone. He died in 1446, when, eccording to
