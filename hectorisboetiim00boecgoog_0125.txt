propterea honesto et immortalitati consulens, qui amplitudine atque

praestantia templum suis ab antecessoribus conditum aequaret, chorum
coepit aedificare. Sed ne ipso fortassis soluto, opus differretur ad finem

of the choir. But lest by his death the work should be delayed being brought
to an end, he resolved that the old choir should not be demolished until all the
materiale had been got together for the completion of the new work. He
therefore collected great heaps of lime and stones, and made other prepara·
tions on a great scale. He selected and encouraged slrilful stonecutters‚
masona and artisans. Thus no small part of the choir was linished before
he departed this life.

About that time, Edward, Bishop of Orkney, who was then in Aberdeen
for the purpose of favouring the cause of learning, dedicated, with the usual
ceremony and much solemnity, the College church (of which mention was
made above). He was a man who, by reason of his learning and holy life,
had been raised to the highest honou'rs. He was the loving patron of all
learned men, as is clearly proved by his uniform kindness to all such in
Aberdeen.

The last taslr Bishop William undertook was the building of a bridge
over the Dee, a pious and public-spirited work. In a short time he had
collected an immense quantity of stones and timber as well as rubble stenes
sufficient for a great part of the whole worlr. He also secured the services
of distinguished craftsmen for the worlr.
