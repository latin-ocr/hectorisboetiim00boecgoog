One is sorry to see a great poet like Gavin Douglas taking part
in the sorry intrigues ol the day. Gavin Dunbar, too, seems to
have hardly known where his duty lay, sor he at first supported
the Regent Albany against the queen-mother, and was lor so
doing imprisoned lor several months. Shortly afterwards we
find him along with others associated with the queen-mother
