conveniently to instruct the crowds who assembled there in Lent‚ to punish

in ecclesiastical fashion those that had erred from the path of virtue, and to pass

the sacred season of Easter with greater solemnity and pomp. T he summer ⁶
and autumn he spent at Feterneyr and Rain. ln order to facilitate the
journeys to all parts of his· diocese, which he undertook to educate his flock

and correct their errors, he began to build in the four different parts mentioned
episcopal dwellings (they were called the bishop’s manses). 'l'wo of these he
completed‚ one at Aberdeem the other at Fetymeyr, although he was in various

ways distracted by the confusion into which the English along with Edward
Baliol had at that time thrown a great part of the country.

About that time thirty English ships cast anchor by night in the
roadstead adjoining the harbour. Then landing their forces they had
entered the city almost before the citizens knew that they had come. A
terrible panic ensued, so that the streets were everywhere filled with crowds
of fleeing men, women and children. The English, having before suffered
adefeat at Aberdeen, of which we have spoken, killed in their anger many
of the citizens. They burned the city along with the residences of the
bishop and canons, after they had stripped these of everything which could
be carried off. Aberdeen bumed. for six days, a sad sight to the beholders.
