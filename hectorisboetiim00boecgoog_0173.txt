pursued by privateers and barely escaped from them. From Tytler'sHistoey,Vol.1V.
p. 337, it will be seen that the Hanse towns made repeated complaints that the Scots
had plundered their merchantmen. ln retaliation the members ol the league refused
the Scots all commercial intercourse. lt is ordered by a Hanse statute ol the year
1412 that no member ol the league should purchase ol Scotsmen at Bruges or any
other place eloth either dressed or undremed, or made from Scottish wool. Similar
restrictione were made in 1418 and 1426. ln 1445 a commission was sent by James 11.
to endeavour to put an end to these disputes. An account ol it will be lound in Tytler.
ln 1466, in consequence ol some misunderstanding with the Flemings, ol which there
is no truce in history, all Scottish merchants were forbidden to trade with the ports
ol the Swyn, the Sluse, the Dam or Bruges. Acts os Parl. os scotland, Vol. 11. 87.

P. 47, l. 15. Bishop Spens can hardly have been so potent a lactor in the Wara
ol the Rosea as Boece makes him out to be. The House ol Lancaster as represented
by Henry Vl. and Queen Margaret undoubtedly got Scottish support; but the
Scottish policy was not to take a side as between York and Lancaster but to preserve
peace with England. The Earl ol Warwick, moreover, could hardly be said to have
been ruined by any power outside oi England. lndeed he was not always identified
with the Yorkist laetiori, as Boece seems to make him. 1
