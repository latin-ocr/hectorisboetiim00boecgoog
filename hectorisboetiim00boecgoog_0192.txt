Ι. p. 72· Since the destruction by Cromwell of the English Regalis, these Scottiab
‘⁶ Jowellis,’' as they used to be called, are ⁴the only ancient insignia of royalty 1111 11
the kingdom.

P. 105, I. 2. Louis xn, King of France, had defeated the Milanese in a cam·
paign in which a famous Scotsman, Stuart, Lord of Aubigny, had greatly distin·
guished himself. The kingdom of Naples had been divided between the Kings of
France and Spain. 11111111111110011511111111111111111505. Boece, witbhis
usual carelessness, speaks of these events as if they had happened immediately before
Floddenin1513. Aa account of the French campaigns in Italy will be found in
Philip de Comines

P. 105, 1. 8. Transfmndam: not quite accurately used. It seems used as a
future participle passive. The proper meaning is necessity, not futurity.

P. 105, 1. 13. It would have been neater to have said utrique populo comprobato

P. 103,l. 16. Venientes erroneously used. It should 11141111 umbem. James
must have been highly 1111111111 11 this time (1512), 101 about the same date envoys
from the Pope, from France, England and Spain, waited on him. He remained loyal
throughout to his old aIIy.

P. 104, 1. 5. The syntax of this sentence is all wrong. lt is impossible to con·
strue animi serum, 111 apparently 1111111111 and cupiditas are both intended to be the
subject of 0011111101. Porouaroi should rather be subjunctive.

P. 104, 1. 12. Licet, 111., would be better 11111 essm amici.

P. 105, 1. 4. Inspropero is alate word, borrowed apparently 11011 the Vulgate,
where it is used of the railing 01 the impenitent thicf on the cross.

P. 105, l. 8. The herald who was despatched to Prance found Henry v111.
besiegiog Terouen. The message to Henry was far from conciliatory, and he broke
into an ungovernable passion. The letter to 11111 111111 11 the British Museum,
Caligulas, VI. 49, 50. 11 hasbeen printed by Hollinshead. The substance of it is
given in 'I'ytler‚ V. 55. 811 also Days osJanws I V., pp. 141147.
