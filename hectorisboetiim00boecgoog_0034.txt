PREFACE. V

our nation but its very memory was that monarch inflamed. By this calamity
the books, in which the deeds ol the Scottish bishops were recorded, were
utterly destroyed. The result ol this has been that our nobles¹ are almost
entirely ignorant of the deeds of their ancestors, while our bishops are unable
to leam anything about their predecessore except their names and a very few
lacte about them; but cannot know in detail either their services to their
country and to the Church, however great may have been their efforts in their
behalf. For the fact is, that having tried to lind out with the most earnest
care (and my researches were made at your suggestion) who have been
Bishops ol Aberdeen, and what was their character, up to the time ol' King
Robert the First 1 have found hardly anything recorded of them save their
names. But the result of my investigatione 1 have put into a single treatise,
so that my readers may know that Aberdeen, at least from the time that that
diocese has possessed episcopal supervision, has hardly ever lacked a bishop
ι notable lor learning and virtue. The present book, however humble, 1 have
dedicated to you, venerable Bishop, and, as far a's 1 know, it is reasonable
to believe that it will afford you pleasure; lor no composition ie likely to please
you so much as one which adds to the glory of your predecessors. They un·
questionably were, both in zeal and learning, worthy models for all who any·
where hold sacred office·

Accept then, 1 beseech you, this little work which, humble as it is, yet
deserves to be presented to you, because the praises of your predecessore
lound in it can never be mentioned without honour to you. For the general
hope is, aod that too, well-grounded, that both in religious and civic affairs,
you will very soon equal the greatest of them. Adieu, and may you ever be
happy. From your College at Aberdeen, 31st August, 1521·
