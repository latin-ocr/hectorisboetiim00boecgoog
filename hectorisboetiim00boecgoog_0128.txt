habenda memoria Inter quae, cum prope infinitis opprimeretur curis,
nunquam tamen ab re divina animum avertit ; neque juvenis neque senex,
publicus aut privatus, sese abdicavit literis. Senex, ubi dabatur otium,
acrae scripturae voluminibus, monumentis prophetarum, apostolorum,
interpretum sacrorum doctorum, nonnunquam philosophorum, quae ad5
beatam praesertim conducunt vitam, admodum delectabatur. Interea
summo otio, summa versabatur tranquillitate solus, ubi nihil ei non
voluptatis plenum. Eo in otio et solitudine, secum nonnunquam loque·

ceptis: hoc otium, haec Wilhelmi solitudo. Splendidissimus fuit in.1o
familiae victm vix unquam coenabat si non multis magnatibus sociatus,

his solitary hours. He kept a splendid table. He hardly ever dined without
noble company, and while the table was always sumptuous, he himself amid

while he detested all scurrilous talk. Hehad such natural ability and mental
vigour that he never failed to rise to any ⁴ occasion either in public or private
lite. He was equally at home in civil and religious affairs, possessing as he
