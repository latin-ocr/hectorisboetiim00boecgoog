Bellum inde per caduceatorem Anglis illico ubi in Galliam trajecerant
indictum, infelicem paulo post exitum sortiturum. Quanta incommoda
hoc bellum utrique populo attulerit, Scotorum historiae, quam habemus ιο
in manibus, opportuno loco, nostro pro ingenio ostendemus. Sed hic
terminis nostris minime egrediemur. Wilhelmus ubi funestam cladem, ·
infelici cum Anglis congressu, nostros accepisse cognoverat, animi dolore

no experience of the horrors of war, thought war in theory desirable, that it could

matter. Bnt in the present work 1 shall not wander from my legitimate
object When Bishop William heard of the fatal defeat which our anns
sustained in the conflict with the English, he was filled with grief and fell into
that disorder which brought him to his end. Never again was he seen to
smile, never to enjoy any jokes, any mirth however innocent. Not long after,
a council of the magnates was called at Perth to consider the interests of the
state. In that assembly Bishop William was, by the authority of the canons
