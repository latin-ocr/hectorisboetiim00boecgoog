This is strong, but probably not undeserved criticism.

Coming to details, we find in the Presace to the present work
reference to histories of Scotland kept in special buildings in
lona as far back as the reign os King Fergus. lt may be said,
without much hesitation, that these never existed. ln the same
Preface King Edward l. is accused of destroying all the national

honour at that time prevailed ”. The fact that he gives the long

period of 113 years as the tigre during which the first three
