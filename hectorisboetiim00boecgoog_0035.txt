HECTOR BOETIUS DEIDONENSIS DE VITIS PONTIFICUM
ABERDONENSIUM.

MALCOLMUS KENNETI Scotorum regno potitus, lerocis
populi efferatos animos religione mitigare, eamque gentem, quae inter

duos amnes Deyam ac Speyam sedes habet, magistratuum indulgentia
effrenem (immenso enim itinere suo ab episcopo disjungebantur) jure,
§legibusque ac moribus, imbuere parans, Murthlaci pontificem sacrum
magistratum primus omnium instituit, sui regni anno sexto, mundanae
originis sexies millesimo ducentesimo nono, adventus Christi in carnem
decimo supra millesimum: Beanumque virum disciplina, fide et pietate
insignem, ibi creatum pontificem sacrae aedis condendae loco, praediis
10 et agris de Murthlaco, Cloueth, et Dunmeth, horum cum ecclesiasticis
redditibus, ad perpetuos pontificios sumptus donavit. Neque alium
erogationis diplomatibus (chartas dicunt nostri) praeter se inscripsit
testem; tanta tum fides mortalium animos regebat: diplomata extant

BISHOPS OF ABERDEEN.

, Malcolm, the son of Kenneth, having succeeded to the Scottish throne,
wished by religion to solten the manners ol his fierce subjects, and more
particularly those of them that dwell between the rivers Dee and Spey. These
by the indulgence of their rulers (for they were separated by a long journey
from their bishop) had given way to every sort ol licence. With a view there-
loreto inspire them with a love ol justice, law, and civilisation generally, he
first of all men established the sacred office ol the Bishopric ol Mortlach. This

took place in the sixth year ol his reign, in the year ol the world 6209, and in
the roroth year after the advent of Christ. He appointed as bishop, BEAN,
arnan ol notable learning, saith and piety. ln order to erect there a sacred
house he endowed him with the estates and lands ol Mortlach, Clova and

Dunmeth, assigning the ecclesiastical revenues of these lor the support ol the
bishops in all timeto come Nor did he cause adbibit to the documents
whereby he gilted these lando (they are called chartas now-a·days) any name as
witness but his own. Such confidence in men's honour at that time prevailed. ⁸
